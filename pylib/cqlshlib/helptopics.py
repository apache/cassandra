        The SELECT expression determines which columns will appear in the

        It is worth noting that unlike the projection in a SQL SELECT, there is
        no guarantee that the results will contain all of the columns
        specified. This is because Cassandra is schema-less and there are no
        guarantees that a given column exists.

        When the COUNT aggregate function is specified as a column to fetch, a
        single row will be returned, with a single column named "count" whose
        value is the number of rows from the pre-aggregation resultset.
