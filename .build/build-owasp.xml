            default value for cveValidForHours is 4 after which sync is done again

            skipping using two specific caches at the end is solving (1)

            failBuildOnCVSS is by default 11 so build would never fail,
            the table categorising vulnerabilities is here (2), so by setting
            "failBuildOnCVSS" to 1, we will fail the build on any CVE found
            if it is not suppressed already dependency-check-suppressions.xml

            If a vendor provides no details about a vulnerability,
            NVD will score that vulnerability as 10.0 (the highest rating translating to critical).
