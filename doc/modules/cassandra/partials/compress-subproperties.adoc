=== compression = { compression_map }
:description: Sets table compression.

Configure the `compression_map` by specifying the compression algorithm `class` followed by the subproperties in simple JSON format.

[TIP]
====
Implement custom compression classes using the `org.apache.cassandra.io.compress.ICompressor` interface.

[IMPORTANT]
==== 
Use only compression implementations bundled with {product}.

Choosing the right compressor depends on your requirements for space savings over read performance.
LZ4 is fastest to decompress, followed by Snappy, then by Deflate.
Compression effectiveness is inversely correlated with decompression speed.
The extra compression from Deflate or Snappy is not enough to make up for the decreased performance for general-purpose workloads, but for archival data they may be worth considering.
+
*Default*: `LZ4Compressor`.
*chunk_length_in_kb* ::
Size (in KB) of the block.
On disk, SSTables are compressed by block to allow random reads.
Values larger than the default value might improve the compression rate, but increases the minimum size of data to be read from disk when a read occurs.
The default value is a good middle ground for compressing tables.
Adjust compression size to account for read/write access patterns (how much data is typically requested at once) and the average size of rows in the table.
+
*Default*: `64`.
*crc_check_chance* ::
When compression is enabled, each compressed block includes a checksum of that block for the purpose of detecting disk bit rot and avoiding the propagation of corruption to other replica.
This option defines the probability with which those checksums are checked during read.
By default they are always checked.
Set to 0 to disable checksum checking and to 0.5, for instance, to check them on every other read.
+
*Default*: `1.0`.
*sstable_compression* ::
Disables compression.
Specify a null value.
