= The Cassandra Query Language (CQL)

This document describes the Cassandra Query Language
(CQL) version 3.
Note that this document describes the last version of the language.
However, the xref:cassandra:developing/cql/changes.adoc[changes] section provides the differences between the versions of CQL since version 3.0.

CQL offers a model similar to SQL.
The data is stored in *tables* containing *rows* of *columns*.
For that reason, when used in this document, these terms (tables, rows and columns) have the same definition that they have in SQL.
