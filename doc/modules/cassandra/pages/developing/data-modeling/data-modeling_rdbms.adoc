= RDBMS design

When you set out to build a new data-driven application that will use a
relational database, you might start by modeling the domain as a set of
properly normalized tables and use foreign keys to reference related
data in other tables.

The figure below shows how you might represent the data storage for your
application using a relational database model. The relational model
includes a couple of “join” tables in order to realize the many-to-many
relationships from the conceptual model of hotels-to-points of interest,
rooms-to-amenities, rooms-to-availability, and guests-to-rooms (via a
reservation).

== Design Differences Between RDBMS and Cassandra

Let's take a minute to highlight some of the key differences in doing
data modeling for Cassandra versus a relational database.

=== No joins

You cannot perform joins in Cassandra. If you have designed a data model
and find that you need something like a join, you'll have to either do
the work on the client side, or create a denormalized second table that
represents the join results for you. This latter option is preferred in
Cassandra data modeling. Performing joins on the client should be a very
rare case; you really want to duplicate (denormalize) the data instead.

=== No referential integrity

Although Cassandra supports features such as lightweight transactions
and batches, Cassandra itself has no concept of referential integrity
across tables. In a relational database, you could specify foreign keys
in a table to reference the primary key of a record in another table.
But Cassandra does not enforce this. It is still a common design
requirement to store IDs related to other entities in your tables, but
operations such as cascading deletes are not available.

=== Denormalization

In relational database design, you are often taught the importance of
normalization. This is not an advantage when working with Cassandra
because it performs best when the data model is denormalized. It is
often the case that companies end up denormalizing data in relational
databases as well. There are two common reasons for this. One is
performance. Companies simply can't get the performance they need when
they have to do so many joins on years' worth of data, so they
denormalize along the lines of known queries. This ends up working, but
goes against the grain of how relational databases are intended to be
designed, and ultimately makes one question whether using a relational
database is the best approach in these circumstances.

A second reason that relational databases get denormalized on purpose is
a business document structure that requires retention. That is, you have
an enclosing table that refers to a lot of external tables whose data
could change over time, but you need to preserve the enclosing document
as a snapshot in history. The common example here is with invoices. You
already have customer and product tables, and you'd think that you could
just make an invoice that refers to those tables. But this should never
be done in practice. Customer or price information could change, and
then you would lose the integrity of the invoice document as it was on
the invoice date, which could violate audits, reports, or laws, and
cause other problems.

In the relational world, denormalization violates Codd's normal forms,
and you try to avoid it. But in Cassandra, denormalization is, well,
perfectly normal. It's not required if your data model is simple. But
don't be afraid of it.

Historically, denormalization in Cassandra has required designing and
managing multiple tables using techniques described in this
documentation. Beginning with the 3.0 release, Cassandra provides a
feature known as `materialized views <materialized-views>` which allows
you to create multiple denormalized views of data based on a base table
design. Cassandra manages materialized views on the server, including
the work of keeping the views in sync with the table.

=== Query-first design

Relational modeling, in simple terms, means that you start from the
conceptual domain and then represent the nouns in the domain in tables.
You then assign primary keys and foreign keys to model relationships.
When you have a many-to-many relationship, you create the join tables
that represent just those keys. The join tables don't exist in the real
world, and are a necessary side effect of the way relational models
work. After you have all your tables laid out, you can start writing
queries that pull together disparate data using the relationships
defined by the keys. The queries in the relational world are very much
secondary. It is assumed that you can always get the data you want as
long as you have your tables modeled properly. Even if you have to use
several complex subqueries or join statements, this is usually true.

By contrast, in Cassandra you don't start with the data model; you start
with the query model. Instead of modeling the data first and then
writing queries, with Cassandra you model the queries and let the data
be organized around them. Think of the most common query paths your
application will use, and then create the tables that you need to
support them.

Detractors have suggested that designing the queries first is overly
constraining on application design, not to mention database modeling.
But it is perfectly reasonable to expect that you should think hard
about the queries in your application, just as you would, presumably,
think hard about your relational domain. You may get it wrong, and then
you'll have problems in either world. Or your query needs might change
over time, and then you'll have to work to update your data set. But
this is no different from defining the wrong tables, or needing
additional tables, in an RDBMS.

=== Designing for optimal storage

In a relational database, it is frequently transparent to the user how
tables are stored on disk, and it is rare to hear of recommendations
about data modeling based on how the RDBMS might store tables on disk.
However, that is an important consideration in Cassandra. Because
Cassandra tables are each stored in separate files on disk, it's
important to keep related columns defined together in the same table.

A key goal that you will see as you begin creating data models in
Cassandra is to minimize the number of partitions that must be searched
in order to satisfy a given query. Because the partition is a unit of
storage that does not get divided across nodes, a query that searches a
single partition will typically yield the best performance.

=== Sorting is a design decision

In an RDBMS, you can easily change the order in which records are
returned to you by using `ORDER BY` in your query. The default sort
order is not configurable; by default, records are returned in the order
in which they are written. If you want to change the order, you just
modify your query, and you can sort by any list of columns.

In Cassandra, however, sorting is treated differently; it is a design
decision. The sort order available on queries is fixed, and is
determined entirely by the selection of clustering columns you supply in
the `CREATE TABLE` command. The CQL `SELECT` statement does support
`ORDER BY` semantics, but only in the order specified by the clustering
columns.
