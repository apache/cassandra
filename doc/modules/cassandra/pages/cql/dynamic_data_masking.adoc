= Dynamic Data Masking

Dynamic data masking (DDM) allows to obscure sensitive information while still allowing access to the masked columns.
DDM doesn't change the stored data. Instead, it just presents the data on their obscured form during `SELECT` queries.
This aims to provide some degree of protection against accidental data exposure. However, it's important to know that
anyone with direct access to the sstable files will be able to read the clear data.

== Masking functions

DDM is based on a set of CQL native functions that obscure sensitive information. The available functions are:

include::partial$masking_functions.adoc[]

Those functions can be discretionarily used on `SELECT` queries to get an obscured view of the data. For example:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/select_with_mask_functions.cql[]
----

== Attaching masking functions to table columns

The masking functions can be permanently attached to the columns of a table.
In that case, `SELECT` queries will always return the column values in their masked form.
The masking will be transparent for the users running `SELECT` queries,
so their only way to know that a column is masked will be consulting the table definition.

This is an optional feature that should be enabled with the `dynamic_data_masking_enabled` property in `cassandra.yaml`,
since it's disabled by default.

The masks of the columns of a table can be defined on `CREATE TABLE` queries:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_create_table.cql[]
----

Note that in the example above we are referencing the `mask_inner` function with two arguments.
However, that CQL function actually has three arguments when explicitely used on `SELECT` queries.
The first argument is always ommitted when attaching the function to a schema column.
The value of that first argument is always interpreted as the value of the masked column, in this case a `text` column.
For the same reason the call to `mask_default` attached to the column doesn't have any argument,
even when that function requires one argument when explicitely used on `SELECT` queries.

Data can be inserted into the masked table as usual. For example:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_insert_data.cql[]
----

The attached column masks will make `SELECT` queries automatically return masked data,
without the need of including the masking function on the query:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_select_with_masked_columns.cql[]
----

The masking function attached to a column can be changed with an `ALTER TABLE` query:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_alter_mask.cql[]
----

In a similar way, a masking function can be dettached from a column with an `ALTER TABLE` query:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_drop_mask.cql[]
----

== Permissions

The `UNMASK` permission allows users to retrieve the unmasked values of masked columns.
The masks will only be applied to the results of a `SELECT` query if the user doesn't have the `UNMASK` permission.
Ordinary users are created without the `UNMASK` permission, whereas superusers do have it.

As an example, suppose that we have a table with masked columns:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_create_table.cql[]
----

And we insert some data into the table:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_insert_data.cql[]
----

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_select_without_unmask_permission.cql[]
----

Then we create two users with `SELECT` permission for the table, but we only grant the `UNMASK` permission to one of
the users:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_create_users.cql[]
----

We can now see that the user with the `UNMASK` permission can see the clear data, without any masking:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_select_with_unmask_permission.cql[]
----

However, the user without the `UNMASK` permission can only see the masked data:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_select_without_unmask_permission.cql[]
----

The `UNMASK` permission works as any other permission. Thus, it can be revoked in any moment:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_revoke_unmask.cql[]
----

Please note that the anonymous user that is used when authentication is disabled has all the permissions.
Since it includes the `UNMASK` permission, that anonymous user will always see the clear data.
In other words, attaching data masking functions to columns only makes sense if authentication is enabled.

Users without the `UNMASK` permission are not allowed to use masked columns in the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` query.
This prevents malicious users from figuring out the clear data by running exhaustive queries. For instance:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_select_without_select_masked.cql[]
----

However, there are some use cases where trusted database users just need a useful way to produce masked data
that will be served to untrusted external users.
For example, a trusted app can connect to the database and extract masked data that will be served to its end users.
In that case the trusted user (the app) can be given the `SELECT_MASKED` permission.
That permission allows to use masked columns in the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` query,
while still seeing the masked data in the query results. For instance:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_select_with_select_masked.cql[]
----

== Custom functions

xref:cql/functions.adoc#user-defined-scalar-functions[User-defined functions (UDFs)] can be attached to a table column.
The UDFs used for masking should belong to the same keyspace as the masked table.
The column value to mask will be passed as the first argument of the attached UDF.
Thus, the UDFs attached to a column should have at least one argument,
and that argument should have the same type as the masked column.
Also, the attached UDF should return values of the same type as the maked column. For instance:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_create_table_with_udf.cql[]
----

This creates a dependency between the table schema and the functions.
Any attempt to drop the function will be rejected while this dependency exists.
Thus, to drop the function you should first drop the mask.
This can be done with:

[source,cql]
----
include::example$CQL/ddm_drop_mask.cql[]
----

Dropping the column, or its containing table, or its containing keyspace would also remove the dependency.

xref:cql/functions.adoc#aggregate-functions[Aggregate functions] cannot be used as masking functions.
