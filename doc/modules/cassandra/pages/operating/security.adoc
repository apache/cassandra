= Security

There are three main components to the security features provided by
Cassandra:

* TLS/SSL encryption for client and inter-node communication
* Client authentication
* Authorization

By default, these features are disabled as Cassandra is configured to
easily find and be found by other members of a cluster. In other words,
an out-of-the-box Cassandra installation presents a large attack surface
for a bad actor. Enabling authentication for clients using the binary
protocol is not sufficient to protect a cluster. Malicious users able to
access internode communication and JMX ports can still:

* Craft internode messages to insert users into authentication schema
* Craft internode messages to truncate or drop schema
* Use tools such as `sstableloader` to overwrite `system_auth` tables
* Attach to the cluster directly to capture write traffic

Correct configuration of all three security components should negate
theses vectors. Therefore, understanding Cassandra's security features
is crucial to configuring your cluster to meet your security needs.

== TLS/SSL Encryption

Cassandra provides secure communication between a client machine and a
database cluster and between nodes within a cluster. Enabling encryption
ensures that data in flight is not compromised and is transferred
securely. The options for client-to-node and node-to-node encryption are
managed separately and may be configured independently.

In both cases, the JVM defaults for supported protocols and cipher
suites are used when encryption is enabled. These can be overidden using
the settings in `cassandra.yaml`, but this is not recommended unless
there are policies in place which dictate certain settings or a need to
disable vulnerable ciphers or protocols in cases where the JVM cannot be
updated.

FIPS compliant settings can be configured at the JVM level and should
not involve changing encryption settings in cassandra.yaml. See
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/FIPS.html[the
java document on FIPS] for more details.

Cassandra provides flexibility of using Java based key material or
completely customizing the SSL context. You can choose any keystore
format supported by Java (JKS, PKCS12 etc) as well as other standards
like PEM. You can even customize the SSL context creation to use Cloud
Native technologies like Kuberenetes Secrets for storing the key
material or to integrate with your in-house Key Management System.

For information on generating the keystore and truststore files
required with the Java supported keystores used in SSL communications,
see the
http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#CreateKeystore[java
documentation on creating keystores].

For customizing the SSL context creation you can implement
https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/security/ISslContextFactory.java[ISslContextCreationFactory]
interface or extend one of its public subclasses appropriately. You
can then use the `ssl_context_factory` setting for
`server_encryption_options` or `client_encryption_options` sections
appropriately. See https://github.com/apache/cassandra/tree/trunk/examples/ssl-factory[ssl-factory examples]
for details. Refer to the below class diagram to understand the
class hierarchy.

image::cassandra_ssl_context_factory_pem.png[image]

=== Using PEM based key material

You can use the in-built class `PEMBasedSSLContextFactory` as the
`ssl_context_factory` setting for the PEM based key material.

You can configure this factory with either inline PEM data or with the
files having the required PEM data as shown below,

* Configuration: PEM keys/certs defined in-line (mind the spaces in the
YAML!)

....
   client/server_encryption_options:
     ssl_context_factory:
        class_name: org.apache.cassandra.security.PEMBasedSslContextFactory
        parameters:
            private_key: |
             -----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----- OR -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
             <your base64 encoded private key>
             -----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY----- OR -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
             -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
             <your base64 encoded certificate chain>
             -----END CERTIFICATE-----

            private_key_password: "<your password if the private key is encrypted with a password>"

            trusted_certificates: |
              -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
              <your base64 encoded certificate>
              -----END CERTIFICATE-----
....

* Configuration: PEM keys/certs defined in files
....
    client/server_encryption_options:
     ssl_context_factory:
        class_name: org.apache.cassandra.security.PEMBasedSslContextFactory
     keystore: <file path to the keystore file in the PEM format with the private key and the certificate chain>
     keystore_password: "<your password if the private key is encrypted with a password>"
     truststore: <file path to the truststore file in the PEM format>
....

== SSL Certificate Hot Reloading

Beginning with Cassandra 4, Cassandra supports hot reloading of SSL
Certificates. If SSL/TLS support is enabled in Cassandra and you are
using default file based key material, the node periodically (every
10 minutes) polls the Trust and Key Stores specified in
cassandra.yaml. When the files are updated, Cassandra will reload
them and use them for subsequent connections. Please note that the
Trust & Key Store passwords are part of the yaml so the updated files
should also use the same passwords.

If you are customizing the SSL configuration via `ssl_context_factory`
setting, Cassandra polls (at the same periodic interval mentioned above)
your implementation to check if the SSL certificates need to be
reloaded. See the https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/security/ISslContextFactory.java#L90[ISslContextFactory] documentation for more details.
If you are using one of the Cassandra's in-built SSL context factory
class (example: PEMBasedSslContextFactory) with file based key
material, it supports the hot reloading of the SSL certificates like
mentioned above.

Certificate Hot reloading may also be triggered using the
`nodetool reloadssl` command. Use this if you want to Cassandra to
immediately notice the changed certificates.

=== Inter-node Encryption

The settings for managing inter-node encryption are found in
`cassandra.yaml` in the `server_encryption_options` section. To enable
inter-node encryption, change the `internode_encryption` setting from
its default value of `none` to one value from: `rack`, `dc` or `all`.

=== Client to Node Encryption

The settings for managing client to node encryption are found in
`cassandra.yaml` in the `client_encryption_options` section. There are
two primary toggles here for enabling encryption, `enabled` and
`optional`.

* If neither is set to `true`, client connections are entirely
unencrypted.
* If `enabled` is set to `true` and `optional` is set to `false`, all
client connections must be secured.
* If both options are set to `true`, both encrypted and unencrypted
connections are supported using the same port. Client connections using
encryption with this configuration will be automatically detected and
handled by the server.

As an alternative to the `optional` setting, separate ports can also be
configured for secure and unsecure connections where operational
requirements demand it. To do so, set `optional` to false and use the
`native_transport_port_ssl` setting in `cassandra.yaml` to specify the
port to be used for secure client communication.

[[operation-roles]]
== Roles

Cassandra uses database roles, which may represent either a single user
or a group of users, in both authentication and permissions management.
Role management is an extension point in Cassandra and may be configured
using the `role_manager` setting in `cassandra.yaml`. The default
setting uses `CassandraRoleManager`, an implementation which stores role
information in the tables of the `system_auth` keyspace.

See also the xref:cql/security.adoc#database-roles[`CQL documentation on roles`].

== Authentication

Authentication is pluggable in Cassandra and is configured using the
`authenticator` setting in `cassandra.yaml`. Cassandra ships with two
options included in the default distribution.

By default, Cassandra is configured with `AllowAllAuthenticator` which
performs no authentication checks and therefore requires no credentials.
It is used to disable authentication completely. Note that
authentication is a necessary condition of Cassandra's permissions
subsystem, so if authentication is disabled, effectively so are
permissions.

The default distribution also includes `PasswordAuthenticator`, which
stores encrypted credentials in a system table. This can be used to
enable simple username/password authentication.

[[password-authentication]]
=== Enabling Password Authentication

Before enabling client authentication on the cluster, client
applications should be pre-configured with their intended credentials.
When a connection is initiated, the server will only ask for credentials
once authentication is enabled, so setting up the client side config in
advance is safe. In contrast, as soon as a server has authentication
enabled, any connection attempt without proper credentials will be
rejected which may cause availability problems for client applications.
Once clients are setup and ready for authentication to be enabled,
follow this procedure to enable it on the cluster.

Pick a single node in the cluster on which to perform the initial
configuration. Ideally, no clients should connect to this node during
the setup process, so you may want to remove it from client config,
block it at the network level or possibly add a new temporary node to
the cluster for this purpose. On that node, perform the following steps:

[arabic]
. Open a `cqlsh` session and change the replication factor of the
`system_auth` keyspace. By default, this keyspace uses
`SimpleReplicationStrategy` and a `replication_factor` of 1. It is
recommended to change this for any non-trivial deployment to ensure that
should nodes become unavailable, login is still possible. Best practice
is to configure a replication factor of 3 to 5 per-DC.

[source,cql]
----
ALTER KEYSPACE system_auth WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'DC1': 3, 'DC2': 3};
----

[arabic, start=2]
. Edit `cassandra.yaml` to change the `authenticator` option like so:

[source,yaml]
----
authenticator: PasswordAuthenticator
----

[arabic, start=3]
. Restart the node.
. Open a new `cqlsh` session using the credentials of the default
superuser:

[source,bash]
----
$ cqlsh -u cassandra -p cassandra
----

[arabic, start=5]
. During login, the credentials for the default superuser are read with
a consistency level of `QUORUM`, whereas those for all other users
(including superusers) are read at `LOCAL_ONE`. In the interests of
performance and availability, as well as security, operators should
create another superuser and disable the default one. This step is
optional, but highly recommended. While logged in as the default
superuser, create another superuser role which can be used to bootstrap
further configuration.

[source,cql]
----
# create a new superuser
CREATE ROLE dba WITH SUPERUSER = true AND LOGIN = true AND PASSWORD = 'super';
----

[arabic, start=6]
. Start a new cqlsh session, this time logging in as the new_superuser
and disable the default superuser.

[source,cql]
----
ALTER ROLE cassandra WITH SUPERUSER = false AND LOGIN = false;
----

[arabic, start=7]
. Finally, set up the roles and credentials for your application users
with xref:cql/security.adoc#create-role[`CREATE ROLE`] statements.

At the end of these steps, the one node is configured to use password
authentication. To roll that out across the cluster, repeat steps 2 and
3 on each node in the cluster. Once all nodes have been restarted,
authentication will be fully enabled throughout the cluster.

Note that using `PasswordAuthenticator` also requires the use of
xref:cql/security.adoc#operation-roles[`CassandraRoleManager`].

See also: `setting-credentials-for-internal-authentication`,
xref:cql/security.adoc#create-role[`CREATE ROLE`],
xref:cql/security.adoc#alter-role[`ALTER ROLE`],
xref:xref:cql/security.adoc#alter-keyspace[`ALTER KEYSPACE`] and 
xref:cql/security.adoc#grant-permission[`GRANT PERMISSION`].

== Authorization

Authorization is pluggable in Cassandra and is configured using the
`authorizer` setting in `cassandra.yaml`. Cassandra ships with two
options included in the default distribution.

By default, Cassandra is configured with `AllowAllAuthorizer` which
performs no checking and so effectively grants all permissions to all
roles. This must be used if `AllowAllAuthenticator` is the configured
authenticator.

The default distribution also includes `CassandraAuthorizer`, which does
implement full permissions management functionality and stores its data
in Cassandra system tables.

=== Enabling Internal Authorization

Permissions are modelled as a whitelist, with the default assumption
that a given role has no access to any database resources. The
implication of this is that once authorization is enabled on a node, all
requests will be rejected until the required permissions have been
granted. For this reason, it is strongly recommended to perform the
initial setup on a node which is not processing client requests.

The following assumes that authentication has already been enabled via
the process outlined in `password-authentication`. Perform these steps
to enable internal authorization across the cluster:

[arabic]
. On the selected node, edit `cassandra.yaml` to change the `authorizer`
option like so:

[source,yaml]
----
authorizer: CassandraAuthorizer
----

[arabic, start=2]
. Restart the node.
. Open a new `cqlsh` session using the credentials of a role with
superuser credentials:

[source,bash]
----
$ cqlsh -u dba -p super
----

[arabic, start=4]
. Configure the appropriate access privileges for your clients using
link:cql.html#grant-permission[GRANT PERMISSION] statements. On the
other nodes, until configuration is updated and the node restarted, this
will have no effect so disruption to clients is avoided.

[source,cql]
----
GRANT SELECT ON ks.t1 TO db_user;
----

[arabic, start=5]
. Once all the necessary permissions have been granted, repeat steps 1
and 2 for each node in turn. As each node restarts and clients
reconnect, the enforcement of the granted permissions will begin.

See also: xref:cql/security.adoc#grant-permission[`GRANT PERMISSION`],
xref:cql/security.adoc#grant-all[`GRANT ALL`] and 
xref:cql/security.adoc#revoke-permission[`REVOKE PERMISSION`].

[[auth-caching]]
== Caching

Enabling authentication and authorization places additional load on the
cluster by frequently reading from the `system_auth` tables.
Furthermore, these reads are in the critical paths of many client
operations, and so has the potential to severely impact quality of
service. To mitigate this, auth data such as credentials, permissions
and role details are cached for a configurable period. The caching can
be configured (and even disabled) from `cassandra.yaml` or using a JMX
client. The JMX interface also supports invalidation of the various
caches, but any changes made via JMX are not persistent and will be
re-read from `cassandra.yaml` when the node is restarted.

Each cache has 3 options which can be set:

Validity Period::
  Controls the expiration of cache entries. After this period, entries
  are invalidated and removed from the cache.
Refresh Rate::
  Controls the rate at which background reads are performed to pick up
  any changes to the underlying data. While these async refreshes are
  performed, caches will continue to serve (possibly) stale data.
  Typically, this will be set to a shorter time than the validity
  period.
Max Entries::
  Controls the upper bound on cache size.

The naming for these options in `cassandra.yaml` follows the convention:

* `<type>_validity_in_ms`
* `<type>_update_interval_in_ms`
* `<type>_cache_max_entries`

Where `<type>` is one of `credentials`, `permissions`, or `roles`.

As mentioned, these are also exposed via JMX in the mbeans under the
`org.apache.cassandra.auth` domain.

== JMX access

Access control for JMX clients is configured separately to that for CQL.
For both authentication and authorization, two providers are available;
the first based on standard JMX security and the second which integrates
more closely with Cassandra's own auth subsystem.

The default settings for Cassandra make JMX accessible only from
localhost. To enable remote JMX connections, edit `cassandra-env.sh`
to change the `LOCAL_JMX` setting to
`no`. Under the standard configuration, when remote JMX connections are
enabled, `standard JMX authentication <standard-jmx-auth>` is also
switched on.

Note that by default, local-only connections are not subject to
authentication, but this can be enabled.

If enabling remote connections, it is recommended to also use
xref:operating/security.adoc#jmx-with-ssl[`SSL`] connections.

Finally, after enabling auth and/or SSL, ensure that tools which use
JMX, such as xref:tools/nodetool/nodetools.adoc[`nodetool`] are correctly configured and working
as expected.

=== Standard JMX Auth

Users permitted to connect to the JMX server are specified in a simple
text file. The location of this file is set in `cassandra-env.sh` by the
line:

[source,bash]
----
JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=/etc/cassandra/jmxremote.password"
----

Edit the password file to add username/password pairs:

[source,none]
----
jmx_user jmx_password
----

Secure the credentials file so that only the user running the Cassandra
process can read it :

[source,bash]
----
$ chown cassandra:cassandra /etc/cassandra/jmxremote.password
$ chmod 400 /etc/cassandra/jmxremote.password
----

Optionally, enable access control to limit the scope of what defined
users can do via JMX. Note that this is a fairly blunt instrument in
this context as most operational tools in Cassandra require full
read/write access. To configure a simple access file, uncomment this
line in `cassandra-env.sh`:

[source,bash]
----
#JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=/etc/cassandra/jmxremote.access"
----

Then edit the access file to grant your JMX user readwrite permission:

[source,none]
----
jmx_user readwrite
----

Cassandra must be restarted to pick up the new settings.

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html#gdenv[Using
File-Based Password Authentication In JMX]

=== Cassandra Integrated Auth

An alternative to the out-of-the-box JMX auth is to useeCassandra's own
authentication and/or authorization providers for JMX clients. This is
potentially more flexible and secure but it come with one major caveat.
Namely that it is not available until [.title-ref]#after# a node has
joined the ring, because the auth subsystem is not fully configured
until that point However, it is often critical for monitoring purposes
to have JMX access particularly during bootstrap. So it is recommended,
where possible, to use local only JMX auth during bootstrap and then, if
remote connectivity is required, to switch to integrated auth once the
node has joined the ring and initial setup is complete.

With this option, the same database roles used for CQL authentication
can be used to control access to JMX, so updates can be managed
centrally using just `cqlsh`. Furthermore, fine grained control over
exactly which operations are permitted on particular MBeans can be
acheived via xref:cql/security.adoc#grant-permission[`GRANT PERMISSION`].

To enable integrated authentication, edit `cassandra-env.sh` to
uncomment these lines:

[source,bash]
----
#JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcassandra.jmx.remote.login.config=CassandraLogin"
#JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Djava.security.auth.login.config=$CASSANDRA_HOME/conf/cassandra-jaas.config"
----

And disable the JMX standard auth by commenting this line:

[source,bash]
----
JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=/etc/cassandra/jmxremote.password"
----

To enable integrated authorization, uncomment this line:

[source,bash]
----
#JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcassandra.jmx.authorizer=org.apache.cassandra.auth.jmx.AuthorizationProxy"
----

Check standard access control is off by ensuring this line is commented
out:

[source,bash]
----
#JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=/etc/cassandra/jmxremote.access"
----

With integrated authentication and authorization enabled, operators can
define specific roles and grant them access to the particular JMX
resources that they need. For example, a role with the necessary
permissions to use tools such as jconsole or jmc in read-only mode would
be defined as:

[source,cql]
----
CREATE ROLE jmx WITH LOGIN = false;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL MBEANS TO jmx;
GRANT DESCRIBE ON ALL MBEANS TO jmx;
GRANT EXECUTE ON MBEAN 'java.lang:type=Threading' TO jmx;
GRANT EXECUTE ON MBEAN 'com.sun.management:type=HotSpotDiagnostic' TO jmx;

# Grant the role with necessary permissions to use nodetool commands (including nodetool status) in read-only mode
GRANT EXECUTE ON MBEAN 'org.apache.cassandra.db:type=EndpointSnitchInfo' TO jmx;
GRANT EXECUTE ON MBEAN 'org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageService' TO jmx;

# Grant the jmx role to one with login permissions so that it can access the JMX tooling
CREATE ROLE ks_user WITH PASSWORD = 'password' AND LOGIN = true AND SUPERUSER = false;
GRANT jmx TO ks_user;
----

Fine grained access control to individual MBeans is also supported:

[source,cql]
----
GRANT EXECUTE ON MBEAN 'org.apache.cassandra.db:type=Tables,keyspace=test_keyspace,table=t1' TO ks_user;
GRANT EXECUTE ON MBEAN 'org.apache.cassandra.db:type=Tables,keyspace=test_keyspace,table=*' TO ks_owner;
----

This permits the `ks_user` role to invoke methods on the MBean
representing a single table in `test_keyspace`, while granting the same
permission for all table level MBeans in that keyspace to the `ks_owner`
role.

Adding/removing roles and granting/revoking of permissions is handled
dynamically once the initial setup is complete, so no further restarts
are required if permissions are altered.

See also: xref:cql/security.adoc#permissions[`Permissions`].

=== JMX With SSL

JMX SSL configuration is controlled by a number of system properties,
some of which are optional. To turn on SSL, edit the relevant lines in
`cassandra-env.sh` to uncomment and
set the values of these properties as required:

`com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl`::
  set to true to enable SSL
`com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.need.client.auth`::
  set to true to enable validation of client certificates
`com.sun.management.jmxremote.registry.ssl`::
  enables SSL sockets for the RMI registry from which clients obtain the
  JMX connector stub
`com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.enabled.protocols`::
  by default, the protocols supported by the JVM will be used, override
  with a comma-separated list. Note that this is not usually necessary
  and using the defaults is the preferred option.
`com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl.enabled.cipher.suites`::
  by default, the cipher suites supported by the JVM will be used,
  override with a comma-separated list. Note that this is not usually
  necessary and using the defaults is the preferred option.
`javax.net.ssl.keyStore`::
  set the path on the local filesystem of the keystore containing server
  private keys and public certificates
`javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword`::
  set the password of the keystore file
`javax.net.ssl.trustStore`::
  if validation of client certificates is required, use this property to
  specify the path of the truststore containing the public certificates
  of trusted clients
`javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword`::
  set the password of the truststore file
