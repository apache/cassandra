= Backups

Apache Cassandra stores data in immutable SSTable files. Backups in
Apache Cassandra database are backup copies of the database data that is
stored as SSTable files. Backups are used for several purposes including
the following:

* To store a data copy for durability
* To be able to restore a table if table data is lost due to
node/partition/network failure
* To be able to transfer the SSTable files to a different machine; for
portability

== Types of Backups

Apache Cassandra supports two kinds of backup strategies.

* Snapshots
* Incremental Backups

A _snapshot_ is a copy of a table’s SSTable files at a given time,
created via hard links.
The DDL to create the table is stored as well.
Snapshots may be created by a user or created automatically.
The setting `snapshot_before_compaction` in the `cassandra.yaml` file determines if
snapshots are created before each compaction.
By default, `snapshot_before_compaction` is set to false.
Snapshots may be created automatically before keyspace truncation or dropping of a table by
setting `auto_snapshot` to true (default) in `cassandra.yaml`.
Truncates could be delayed due to the auto snapshots and another setting in
`cassandra.yaml` determines how long the coordinator should wait for
truncates to complete.
By default Cassandra waits 60 seconds for auto snapshots to complete.

An _incremental backup_ is a copy of a table’s SSTable files created by
a hard link when memtables are flushed to disk as SSTables.
Typically incremental backups are paired with snapshots to reduce the backup time
as well as reduce disk space.
Incremental backups are not enabled by default and must be enabled explicitly in `cassandra.yaml` (with
`incremental_backups` setting) or with `nodetool`.
Once enabled, Cassandra creates a hard link to each SSTable flushed or streamed
locally in a `backups/` subdirectory of the keyspace data.
Incremental backups of system tables are also created.

== Data Directory Structure

The directory structure of Cassandra data consists of different
directories for keyspaces, and tables with the data files within the
table directories.
Directories backups and snapshots to store backups
and snapshots respectively for a particular table are also stored within
the table directory.
The directory structure for Cassandra is illustrated in Figure 1.

=== Setting Up Example Tables for Backups and Snapshots

In this section we shall create some example data that could be used to
demonstrate incremental backups and snapshots.
We have used a three node Cassandra cluster.
First, the keyspaces are created.
Then tables are created within a keyspace and table data is added.
We have used two keyspaces `cqlkeyspace` and `catalogkeyspace` with two tables within
each.

Create the keyspace `cqlkeyspace`:

[source,cql]
----
include::cassandra:example$CQL/create_ks_backup.cql[]
----

Create two tables `t` and `t2` in the `cqlkeyspace` keyspace.

[source,cql]
----
include::cassandra:example$CQL/create_table_backup.cql[]
----

Add data to the tables:

[source,cql]
----
include::cassandra:example$CQL/insert_data_backup.cql[]
----

Query the table to list the data:

[source,cql]
----
include::cassandra:example$CQL/select_data_backup.cql[]
----

results in

[source,cql]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/select_data_backup.result[]
----

Create a second keyspace `catalogkeyspace`:

[source,cql]
----
include::cassandra:example$CQL/create_ks2_backup.cql[]
----

Create two tables `journal`  and `magazine` in `catalogkeyspace`:

[source,cql]
----
include::cassandra:example$CQL/create_table2_backup.cql[]
----

Add data to the tables:

[source,cql]
----
include::cassandra:example$CQL/insert_data2_backup.cql[]
----

Query the tables to list the data:

[source,cql]
----
include::cassandra:example$CQL/select_data2_backup.cql[]
----

results in

[source,cql]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/select_data2_backup.result[]
----

== Snapshots

In this section, we demonstrate creating snapshots.
The command used to create a snapshot is `nodetool snapshot` with the usage:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/nodetool_snapshot.sh[]
----

results in

[source, plaintext]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/nodetool_snapshot_help.result[]
----

=== Configuring for Snapshots

To demonstrate creating snapshots with Nodetool on the commandline we
have set `auto_snapshots` setting to `false` in the `cassandra.yaml` file:

[source,yaml]
----
include::cassandra:example$YAML/auto_snapshot.yaml[]
----

Also set `snapshot_before_compaction` to `false` to disable creating
snapshots automatically before compaction:

[source,yaml]
----
include::cassandra:example$YAML/snapshot_before_compaction.yaml[]
----

=== Creating Snapshots

Before creating any snapshots, search for snapshots and none will be listed:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/find_snapshots.sh[]
----

We shall be using the example keyspaces and tables to create snapshots.

==== Taking Snapshots of all Tables in a Keyspace

Using the syntax above, create a snapshot called `catalog-ks` for all the tables
in the `catalogkeyspace` keyspace:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/snapshot_backup2.sh[]
----

results in

[source,none]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/snapshot_backup2.result[]
----

Using the `find` command above, the snapshots and `snapshots` directories
are now found with listed files similar to:

[source, plaintext]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/snapshot_backup2_find.result[]
----

Snapshots of all tables in multiple keyspaces may be created similarly:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/snapshot_both_backups.sh[]
----

==== Taking Snapshots of Single Table in a Keyspace

To take a snapshot of a single table the `nodetool snapshot` command
syntax becomes as follows:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/snapshot_one_table.sh[]
----

Using the syntax above, create a snapshot for table `magazine` in keyspace `catalogkeyspace`:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/snapshot_one_table2.sh[]
----

results in

[source, plaintext]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/snapshot_one_table2.result[]
----

==== Taking Snapshot of Multiple Tables from same Keyspace

To take snapshots of multiple tables in a keyspace the list of
_Keyspace.table_ must be specified with option `--kt-list`.
For example, create snapshots for tables `t` and `t2` in the `cqlkeyspace` keyspace:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/snapshot_mult_tables.sh[]
----

results in

[source,plaintext]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/snapshot_mult_tables.result[]
----

Multiple snapshots of the same set of tables may be created and tagged with a different name.
As an example, create another snapshot for the same set of tables `t` and `t2` in the `cqlkeyspace`
keyspace and tag the snapshots differently:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/snapshot_mult_tables_again.sh[]
----

results in

[source, plaintext]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/snapshot_mult_tables_again.result[]
----

==== Taking Snapshot of Multiple Tables from Different Keyspaces

To take snapshots of multiple tables that are in different keyspaces the
command syntax is the same as when multiple tables are in the same
keyspace.
Each <keyspace>.<table> must be specified separately in the
`--kt-list` option.

For example, create a snapshot for table `t` in
the `cqlkeyspace` and table `journal` in the catalogkeyspace and tag the
snapshot `multi-ks`.

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/snapshot_mult_ks.sh[]
----

results in
[source, plaintext]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/snapshot_mult_ks.result[]
----

=== Listing Snapshots

To list snapshots use the `nodetool listsnapshots` command. All the
snapshots that we created in the preceding examples get listed:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/nodetool_list_snapshots.sh[]
----

results in

[source, plaintext]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/nodetool_list_snapshots.result[]
----

=== Finding Snapshots Directories

The `snapshots` directories may be listed with `find –name snapshots`
command:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/find_snapshots.sh[]
----

results in

[source, plaintext]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/snapshot_all.result[]
----

To list the snapshots for a particular table first change to the snapshots directory for that table.
For example, list the snapshots for the `catalogkeyspace/journal` table:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/find_two_snapshots.sh[]
----

results in

[source, plaintext]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/find_two_snapshots.result[]
----

A `snapshots` directory lists the SSTable files in the snapshot.
A `schema.cql` file is also created in each snapshot that defines schema
that can recreate the table with CQL when restoring from a snapshot:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/snapshot_files.sh[]
----

results in

[source, plaintext]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/snapshot_files.result[]
----

=== Clearing Snapshots

Snapshots may be cleared or deleted with the `nodetool clearsnapshot`
command. Either a specific snapshot name must be specified or the `–all`
option must be specified.

For example, delete a snapshot called `magazine` from keyspace `cqlkeyspace`:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/nodetool_clearsnapshot.sh[]
----

or delete all snapshots from `cqlkeyspace` with the –all option:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/nodetool_clearsnapshot_all.sh[]
----

== Incremental Backups

In the following sections, we shall discuss configuring and creating
incremental backups.

=== Configuring for Incremental Backups

To create incremental backups set `incremental_backups` to `true` in
`cassandra.yaml`.

[source,yaml]
----
include::cassandra:example$YAML/incremental_bups.yaml[]
----

This is the only setting needed to create incremental backups.
By default `incremental_backups` setting is set to `false` because a new
set of SSTable files is created for each data flush and if several CQL
statements are to be run the `backups` directory could fill up quickly
and use up storage that is needed to store table data.
Incremental backups may also be enabled on the command line with the nodetool
command `nodetool enablebackup`.
Incremental backups may be disabled with `nodetool disablebackup` command.
Status of incremental backups, whether they are enabled may be checked with `nodetool statusbackup`.

=== Creating Incremental Backups

After each table is created flush the table data with `nodetool flush`
command. Incremental backups get created.

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/nodetool_flush.sh[]
----

=== Finding Incremental Backups

Incremental backups are created within the Cassandra’s `data` directory
within a table directory. Backups may be found with following command.

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/find_backups.sh[]
----
results in
[source,none]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/find_backups.result[]
----

=== Creating an Incremental Backup

This section discusses how incremental backups are created in more
detail using the keyspace and table previously created.

Flush the keyspace and table:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/nodetool_flush_table.sh[]
----

A search for backups and a `backups` directory will list a backup directory,
even if we have added no table data yet.

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/find_backups.sh[]
----

results in

[source,plaintext]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/find_backups_table.result[]
----

Checking the `backups` directory will show that there are also no backup files:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/check_backups.sh[]
----

results in

[source, plaintext]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/no_bups.result[]
----

If a row of data is added to the data, running the `nodetool flush` command will
flush the table data and an incremental backup will be created:

[source,bash]
----
include::cassandra:example$BASH/flush_and_check.sh[]
----

results in

[source, plaintext]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/flush_and_check.result[]
----

[NOTE]
====
The `backups` directory for any table, such as `cqlkeyspace/t` is created in the
`data` directory for that table.
====

Adding another row of data and flushing will result in another set of incremental backup files.
The SSTable files are timestamped, which distinguishes the first incremental backup from the
second:

[source,none]
----
include::cassandra:example$RESULTS/flush_and_check2.result[]
----

== Restoring from Incremental Backups and Snapshots

The two main tools/commands for restoring a table after it has been
dropped are:

* sstableloader
* nodetool refresh

A snapshot contains essentially the same set of SSTable files as an
incremental backup does with a few additional files. A snapshot includes
a `schema.cql` file for the schema DDL to create a table in CQL. A table
backup does not include DDL which must be obtained from a snapshot when
restoring from an incremental backup.
