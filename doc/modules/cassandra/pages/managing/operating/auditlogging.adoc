= Audit Logging

Audit Logging is a new feature in Apache Cassandra 4.0 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-12151[CASSANDRA-12151]).
This new feature is safe for production use, with configurable limits to heap memory and disk space to prevent out-of-memory errors.
All database activity is logged per-node as file-based records to a specified local filesystem directory. 
The audit log files are rolled periodically based on a configurable value. 

Some of the features of audit logging are:

* No additional database capacity is needed to store audit logs.
* No query tool is required to store the audit logs.
* Latency of database operations is not affected, so there is no performance impact.
* Heap memory usage is bounded by a weighted queue, with configurable maximum weight sitting in front of logging thread.
* Disk utilization is bounded by a configurable size, deleting old log segments once the limit is reached.
* Can be enabled or disabled at startup time using `cassandra.yaml` or at runtime using the JMX tool, ``nodetool``.
* Can configure the settings in either the `cassandra.yaml` file or by using ``nodetool``.

Audit logging includes all CQL requests, both successful and failed. 
It also captures all successful and failed authentication and authorization events, such as login attempts. 
The difference between Full Query Logging (FQL) and audit logging is that FQL captures only successful CQL requests, which allow replay or comparison of logs.
Audit logs are useful for compliance and debugging, while FQL is useful for debugging, performance benchmarking, testing and auditing CQL queries.

== Audit information logged

The audit log contains:

* all events in the configured keyspaces to include
* all events in the configured categories to include
* all events executed by the configured users to include

The audit log does not contain:

* configuration changes made in `cassandra.yaml` file
* `nodetool` commands
* Passwords mentioned as part of DCL statements: Passwords will be obfuscated as \*\*\*\*\*\*\*.
 ** Statements that fail to parse will have everything after the appearance of the word password obfuscated as \*\*\*\*\*\*\*.
 ** Statements with a mistyped word 'password' will be logged without obfuscation. Please make sure to use a different password on retries.

The audit log is a series of log entries. 
An audit log entry contains:

* keyspace (String) - Keyspace on which request is made
* operation (String) - Database operation such as CQL command
* user (String) - User name
* scope (String) - Scope of request such as Table/Function/Aggregate name
* type (AuditLogEntryType) - Type of request
** CQL Audit Log Entry Type
** Common Audit Log Entry Type
* source (InetAddressAndPort) - Source IP Address from which request originated
* timestamp (long ) - Timestamp of the request
* batch (UUID) - Batch of request
* options (QueryOptions) - CQL Query options
* state (QueryState) - State related to a given query

Each entry contains all applicable attributes for the given event, concatenated with a pipe (|).

CQL audit log entry types are the following CQL commands. Each command is assigned to a particular specified category to log:

[width="100%",cols="20%,80%",options="header",]
|===
| Category | CQL commands

| DDL | ALTER_KEYSPACE, CREATE_KEYSPACE, DROP_KEYSPACE, 
ALTER_TABLE, CREATE_TABLE, DROP_TABLE, 
CREATE_FUNCTION, DROP_FUNCTION, 
CREATE_AGGREGATE, DROP_AGGREGATE, 
CREATE_INDEX, DROP_INDEX, 
ALTER_TYPE, CREATE_TYPE, DROP_TYPE,
CREATE_TRIGGER, DROP_TRIGGER,
ALTER_VIEW, CREATE_VIEW, DROP_VIEW,
TRUNCATE
| DML | BATCH, DELETE, UPDATE
| DCL | GRANT, REVOKE, 
ALTER_ROLE, CREATE_ROLE, DROP_ROLE, 
LIST_ROLES, LIST_PERMISSIONS, LIST_USERS
| OTHER | USE_KEYSPACE
| QUERY | SELECT
| PREPARE | PREPARE_STATEMENT
|===

Common audit log entry types are one of the following:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
| Category | CQL commands

| AUTH | LOGIN_SUCCESS, LOGIN_ERROR, UNAUTHORIZED_ATTEMPT
| ERROR | REQUEST_FAILURE
|===

== Availability and durability

NOTE: Unlike data, audit log entries are not replicated

For a given query, the corresponding audit entry is only stored on the coordinator node.
For example, an ``INSERT`` in a keyspace with replication factor of 3 will produce an audit entry on one node, the coordinator who handled the request, and not on the two other nodes.
For this reason, and depending on compliance requirements you must meet,
make sure that audit logs are stored on a non-ephemeral storage.

You can achieve custom needs with the <<archive_command>> option.

== Configuring audit logging in cassandra.yaml

The `cassandra.yaml` file can be used to configure and enable audit logging.
Configuration and enablement may be the same or different on each node, depending on the `cassandra.yaml` file settings.

Audit logging can also be configured using ``nodetool`` when enabling the feature, and will override any values set in the `cassandra.yaml` file, as discussed in <<enabling_audit_with_nodetool, Enabling Audit Logging with nodetool>>.

Audit logs are generated on each enabled node, so logs on each node will have that node's queries.
All options for audit logging can be set in the `cassandra.yaml` file under the ``audit_logging_options:``.

The file includes the following options that can be uncommented for use:

[source, yaml]
----
# Audit logging - Logs every incoming CQL command request, authentication to a node. See the docs
# on audit_logging for full details about the various configuration options.
audit_logging_options:
    enabled: false
    logger:
      - class_name: BinAuditLogger
    # audit_logs_dir:
    # included_keyspaces:
    # excluded_keyspaces: system, system_schema, system_virtual_schema
    # included_categories:
    # excluded_categories:
    # included_users:
    # excluded_users:
    # roll_cycle: HOURLY
    # block: true
    # max_queue_weight: 268435456 # 256 MiB
    # max_log_size: 17179869184 # 16 GiB
    ## archive command is "/path/to/script.sh %path" where %path is replaced with the file being rolled:
    # archive_command:
    # max_archive_retries: 10
----

=== enabled

Control whether audit logging is enabled or disabled (default).

To enable audit logging set ``enabled: true``.

If this option is enabled, audit logging will start when Cassandra is started.
It can be disabled afterwards at runtime with <<enabling_audit_with_nodetool, nodetool>>.

TIP: You can monitor whether audit logging is enabled with ``AuditLogEnabled`` attribute of the JMX MBean ``org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageService``.

=== logger

The type of audit logger is set with the `logger` option. 
Supported values are:

- `BinAuditLogger` (default)
- `FileAuditLogger`
- `NoOpAuditLogger`

`BinAuditLogger` logs events to a file in binary format.
`FileAuditLogger` uses the standard logging mechanism, `slf4j` to log events to the `audit/audit.log` file. It is a synchronous, file-based audit logger. The roll_cycle will be set in the `logback.xml` file.
`NoOpAuditLogger` is a no-op implementation of the audit logger that shoudl be specified when audit logging is disabled.

For example:

[source, yaml]
----
logger: 
  - class_name: FileAuditLogger
----

TIP:  `BinAuditLogger` make use of open source https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue[Chronicle Queue] under the hood. If you consider using audit logging for regulatory compliance purpose, it might be wise to be somewhat familiar with this library. See <<archive_command>> and <<roll_cycle>> for an example of the implications.

=== audit_logs_dir

To write audit logs, an existing directory must be set in ``audit_logs_dir``.

The directory must have appropriate permissions set to allow reading, writing, and executing.
Logging will recursively delete the directory contents as needed.
Do not place links in this directory to other sections of the filesystem.
For example, ``audit_logs_dir: /non_ephemeral_storage/audit/logs/hourly``.

The audit log directory can also be configured using the system property `cassandra.logdir.audit`, which by default is set to `cassandra.logdir + /audit/`.

=== included_keyspaces and excluded_keyspaces

Set the keyspaces to include with the `included_keyspaces` option and
the keyspaces to exclude with the `excluded_keyspaces` option. 
By default, `system`, `system_schema` and `system_virtual_schema` are excluded, and all other keyspaces are included.

For example:
[source, yaml]
----
included_keyspaces: test, demo
excluded_keyspaces: system, system_schema, system_virtual_schema
----

=== included_categories and excluded_categories

The categories of database operations to include are specified with the `included_categories` option as a comma-separated list. 
The categories of database operations to exclude are specified with `excluded_categories` option as a comma-separated list. 
The supported categories for audit log are: `AUTH`, `DCL`, `DDL`, `DML`, `ERROR`, `OTHER`, `PREPARE`, and `QUERY`.
By default, all supported categories are included, and no category is excluded.

[source, yaml]
----
included_categories: AUTH, ERROR, DCL
excluded_categories: DDL, DML, QUERY, PREPARE
----

=== included_users and excluded_users

Users to audit log are set with the `included_users` and `excluded_users` options. 
The `included_users` option specifies a comma-separated list of users to include explicitly.
The `excluded_users` option specifies a comma-separated list of users to exclude explicitly.
By default, all users are included, and no users are excluded.

[source, yaml]
----
included_users: 
excluded_users: john, mary
----

[[roll_cycle]]
=== roll_cycle

The ``roll_cycle`` defines the frequency with which the audit log segments are rolled.
Supported values are:

- ``MINUTELY``
- ``FIVE_MINUTELY``
- ``TEN_MINUTELY``
- ``TWENTY_MINUTELY``
- ``HALF_HOURLY``
- ``HOURLY`` (default)
- ``TWO_HOURLY``
- ``FOUR_HOURLY``
- ``SIX_HOURLY``
- ``DAILY``

For example: ``roll_cycle: DAILY``

WARNING: Read the following paragraph when changing ``roll_cycle`` on a production node.

With the `BinLogger` implementation, any attempt to modify the roll cycle on a node where audit logging was previously enabled will fail silentely due to https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Queue[Chronicle Queue] roll cycle inference mechanism (even if you delete the ``metadata.cq4t`` file).

Here is an example of such an override visible in Cassandra logs:
----
INFO  [main] <DATE TIME> BinLog.java:420 - Attempting to configure bin log: Path: /path/to/audit Roll cycle: TWO_HOURLY [...]
WARN  [main] <DATE TIME> SingleChronicleQueueBuilder.java:477 - Overriding roll cycle from TWO_HOURLY to FIVE_MINUTE
----

In order to change ``roll_cycle`` on a node, you have to:

1. Stop Cassandra
2. Move or offload all audit logs somewhere else (in a safe and durable location)
3. Restart Cassandra.
4. Check Cassandra logs
5. Make sure that audit log filenames under ``audit_logs_dir`` correspond to the new roll cycle.

=== block

The ``block`` option specifies whether audit logging should block writing or drop log records if the audit logging falls behind. Supported boolean values are ``true`` (default) or ``false``.

For example: ``block: false`` to drop records (e.g. if audit is used for troobleshooting)

For regulatory compliance purposes, it's a good practice to explicitly set ``block: true`` to prevent any regression in case of future default value change.

=== max_queue_weight

The ``max_queue_weight`` option sets the maximum weight of in-memory queue for records waiting to be written to the file before blocking or dropping.  The option must be set to a positive value. The default value is 268435456, or 256 MiB.

For example, to change the default: ``max_queue_weight: 134217728 # 128 MiB``

=== max_log_size

The ``max_log_size`` option sets the maximum size of the rolled files to retain on disk before deleting the oldest file.  The option must be set to a positive value. The default is 17179869184, or 16 GiB.
For example, to change the default: ``max_log_size: 34359738368 # 32 GiB``

WARNING: ``max_log_size`` is ignored if ``archive_command`` option is set.

[[archive_command]]
=== archive_command

NOTE: If ``archive_command`` option is empty or unset (default), Cassandra uses a built-in DeletingArchiver that deletes the oldest files if ``max_log_size`` is reached.

The ``archive_command`` option sets the user-defined archive script to execute on rolled log files.
For example: ``archive_command: "/usr/local/bin/archiveit.sh %path"``

``%path`` is replaced with the absolute file path of the file being rolled.

When using a user-defined script, Cassandra does **not** use the DeletingArchiver, so it's the responsibility of the script to make any required cleanup.

Cassandra will call the user-defined script as soon as the log file is rolled. It means that Chronicle Queue's QueueFileShrinkManager will not be able to shrink the sparse log file because it's done asynchronously. In other words, all log files will have at least the size of the default block size (80 MiB), even if there are only a few KB of real data. Consequently, some warnings will appear in Cassandra system.log:

----
WARN  [main/queue~file~shrink~daemon] <DATE TIME> QueueFileShrinkManager.java:63 - Failed to shrink file as it exists no longer, file=/path/to/xxx.cq4
----

TIP: Because Cassandra does not make use of Pretoucher, you can configure Chronicle Queue to shrink files synchronously -- i.e. as soon as the file is rolled -- with ``chronicle.queue.synchronousFileShrinking`` JVM properties. For instance, you can add the following line at the end of ``cassandra-env.sh``: ``JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dchronicle.queue.synchronousFileShrinking=true"``

=== max_archive_retries

The ``max_archive_retries`` option sets the max number of retries of failed archive commands. The default is 10.

For example: ``max_archive_retries: 10``

Interval between each retry is hard coded to 5 minutes.

[[enabling_audit_with_nodetool]]
== Enabling Audit Logging with ``nodetool``
 
Audit logging is enabled on a per-node basis using the ``nodetool enableauditlog`` command. The logging directory must be defined with ``audit_logs_dir`` in the `cassandra.yaml` file or uses the default value ``cassandra.logdir.audit``.

The syntax of the ``nodetool enableauditlog`` command has all the same options that can be set in the ``cassandra.yaml`` file except ``audit_logs_dir``.
In addition, ``nodetool`` has options to set which host and port to run the command on, and username and password if the command requires authentication.

[source, plaintext]

----

To enable audit logging, run following command on each node in the cluster on which you want to enable logging:

[source, bash]
----
$ nodetool enableauditlog
----

== Disabling audit logging

Use the `nodetool disableauditlog` command to disable audit logging. 

== Viewing audit logs

The `auditlogviewer` tool is used to view (dump) audit logs if the logger was ``BinAuditLogger``.. 
``auditlogviewer`` converts the binary log files into human-readable format; only the audit log directory must be supplied as a command-line option.
If the logger ``FileAuditLogger`` was set, the log file are already in human-readable format and ``auditlogviewer`` is not needed to read files. 


The syntax of `auditlogviewer` is:

[source, plaintext]
----
auditlogviewer

Audit log files directory path is a required argument.
usage: auditlogviewer <path1> [<path2>...<pathN>] [options]
--
View the audit log contents in human readable format
--
Options are:
-f,--follow       Upon reaching the end of the log continue indefinitely
                  waiting for more records
-h,--help         display this help message
-r,--roll_cycle   How often to roll the log file was rolled. May be
                  necessary for Chronicle to correctly parse file names. (MINUTELY, HOURLY,
                  DAILY). Default HOURLY.

== Example

[arabic, start=1]
. To demonstrate audit logging, first configure the ``cassandra.yaml`` file with the following settings:

[source, yaml]
----
audit_logging_options:
   enabled: true
   logger: BinAuditLogger
   audit_logs_dir: "/cassandra/audit/logs/hourly"
   # included_keyspaces:
   # excluded_keyspaces: system, system_schema, system_virtual_schema
   # included_categories:
   # excluded_categories:
   # included_users:
   # excluded_users:
   roll_cycle: HOURLY
   # block: true
   # max_queue_weight: 268435456 # 256 MiB
   # max_log_size: 17179869184 # 16 GiB
   ## archive command is "/path/to/script.sh %path" where %path is replaced with the file being rolled:
   # archive_command:
   # max_archive_retries: 10
----

[arabic, start=2]
. Create the audit log directory `/cassandra/audit/logs/hourly` and set the directory permissions to read, write, and execute for all. 

[arabic, start=3]
. Now create a demo keyspace and table and insert some data using ``cqlsh``:

[source, cql]
----
 cqlsh> CREATE KEYSPACE auditlogkeyspace
   ... WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1};
 cqlsh> USE auditlogkeyspace;
 cqlsh:auditlogkeyspace> CREATE TABLE t (
 ...id int,
 ...k int,
 ...v text,
 ...PRIMARY KEY (id)
 ... );
 cqlsh:auditlogkeyspace> INSERT INTO t (id, k, v) VALUES (0, 0, 'val0');
 cqlsh:auditlogkeyspace> INSERT INTO t (id, k, v) VALUES (0, 1, 'val1');
----

All the supported CQL commands will be logged to the audit log directory.

[arabic, start=4]
. Change directory to the audit logs directory.

[source, bash]
----
$ cd /cassandra/audit/logs/hourly
----

[arabic, start=5]
. List the audit log files and directories. 

[source, bash]
----
$ ls -l
----

You should see results similar to:

[source, plaintext]
----
total 28
-rw-rw-r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user    65536 Aug  2 03:01 directory-listing.cq4t

-rw-rw-r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user 83886080 Aug  2 03:01 20190802-03.cq4
----

The audit log files will all be listed with a `.cq4` file type. The audit directory is of `.cq4t` type.

[arabic, start=6]
. Run `auditlogviewer` tool to view the audit logs. 

[source, bash]
----
$ auditlogviewer /cassandra/audit/logs/hourly
----

This command will return a readable version of the log. Here is a partial sample of the log for the commands in this demo:

== Diagnostic events for user audit logging

Any native transport-enabled client can subscribe to audit log events for diagnosing cluster issues.
These events can be consumed by external tools to implement a Cassandra user auditing solution.
