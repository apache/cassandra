= jvm-* files

Several files for JVM configuration are included in Cassandra. The
`jvm-server.options` file, and corresponding files `jvm8-server.options`
and `jvm11-server.options` are the main file for settings that affect
the operation of the Cassandra JVM on cluster nodes. The file includes
startup parameters, general JVM settings such as garbage collection, and
heap settings. The `jvm-clients.options` and corresponding
`jvm8-clients.options` and `jvm11-clients.options` files can be used to
configure JVM settings for clients like `nodetool` and the `sstable`
tools.

See each file for examples of settings.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The `jvm-*` files replace the `cassandra-envsh` file used in Cassandra
versions prior to Cassandra 3.0. The `cassandra-env.sh` bash script file
is still useful if JVM settings must be dynamically calculated based on
system settings. The `jvm-*` files only store static JVM settings.
