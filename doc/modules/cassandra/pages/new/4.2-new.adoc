= New Features in Apache Cassandra 4.2

This section covers the new features in Apache Cassandra 4.2.


* Added new Mathematical CQL functions: abs, exp, log, log10 and round.
* Adds a trie-based memtable implementation
* CQL things - maxwritetime, writetime and ttl on elements of collections and udts
* Added new CQL native scalar functions for collections. The new functions are mostly analogous to the existing
  aggregation functions, but they operate on the elements of collection columns. The new functions are `map_keys`,
  `map_values`, `collection_count`, `collection_min`, `collection_max`, `collection_sum` and `collection_avg`.
* number of options
