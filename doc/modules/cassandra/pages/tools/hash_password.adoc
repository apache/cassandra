= Hash password

The `hash_password` tool is used to get the jBcrypt hash of a password. This hash 
can be used in CREATE/ALTER ROLE/USER statements for improved security.

This feature can be useful if we want to make sure no intermediate system, logging or 
any other possible plain text password leak can happen.

== Usage

hash_password <options>

[cols=",",]
|===

|-h,--help |Displays help message

|-e,--environment-var <arg> |Use value of the specified environment
variable as the password

|-i,--input <arg> |Input is a file (or - for stdin) to read the
password from. Make sure that the whole input including newlines is
considered. For example, the shell command `echo -n foobar \| hash_password
-i -` will work as intended and just hash 'foobar'.

|-p,--plain <arg> |Argument is the plain text password

|-r,--logrounds <arg> |Number of hash rounds (default: 10).
|===

One of the options --environment-var, --plain or --input must be used.
