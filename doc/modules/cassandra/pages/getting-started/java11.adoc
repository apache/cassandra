= Support for Java 11

In the new Java release cadence a new Java version is made available
every six months. The more frequent release cycle is favored as it
brings new Java features to the developers as and when they are
developed without the wait that the earlier 3 year release model
incurred. Not every Java version is a Long Term Support (LTS) version.
After Java 8 the next LTS version is Java 11. Java 9, 10, 12 and 13 are
all non-LTS versions.

One of the objectives of the Apache Cassandra 4.0 version is to support
the recent LTS Java versions 8 and 11
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-9608[CASSANDRA-9608]).
Java 8 and Java 11 may be used to build and run Apache Cassandra 4.0. Effective Cassandra
4.0.2 there is full Java 11 support, it is not experimental anymore.

== Support Matrix

The support matrix for the Java versions for compiling and running
Apache Cassandra 4.0 is detailed in Table 1. The build version is along
the vertical axis and the run version is along the horizontal axis.

Apache 4.0 source code built with Java 11 cannot be run with
Java 8.

All binary releases are built with Java 8.

Next, we shall discuss using each of Java 8 and 11 to build and
run Apache Cassandra 4.0.

== Using Java 8 to Build

To start with, install Java 8. As an example, for installing Java 8 on
RedHat Linux the command is as follows:

....
$ sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
....

Set the environment variables `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH`.

....
$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk
$ export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$JRE_HOME/bin
....

Download and install Apache Cassandra 4.0 source code from the Git along
with the dependencies.

....
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/cassandra.git
....

If Cassandra is already running stop Cassandra with the following
command.

....
$ ./nodetool stopdaemon
....

Build the source code from the `cassandra` directory, which has the
`build.xml` build script. The Apache Ant uses the Java version set in
the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

....
$ cd ~/cassandra
$ ant
....

Apache Cassandra 4.0 gets built with Java 8. Set the environment
variable for `CASSANDRA_HOME` in the bash script. Also add the
`CASSANDRA_HOME/bin` to the `PATH` variable.

....
$ export CASSANDRA_HOME=~/cassandra
$ export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$JRE_HOME/bin:$CASSANDRA_HOME/bin
....

To run Apache Cassandra 4.0 with either of Java 8 or Java 11 run the
Cassandra application in the `CASSANDRA_HOME/bin` directory, which is in
the `PATH` env variable.

....
$ cassandra
....

The Java version used to run Cassandra gets output as Cassandra is
getting started. As an example if Java 11 is used, the run output should
include similar to the following output snippet:

....
INFO  [main] 2019-07-31 21:18:16,862 CassandraDaemon.java:480 - Hostname: ip-172-30-3- 
146.ec2.internal:7000:7001

....

The following output indicates a single node Cassandra 4.0 cluster has
started.

....

jump to NORMAL
....

== Using Java 11 to Build

If Java 11 is used to build Apache Cassandra 4.0, first Java 11 must be
installed and the environment variables set. As an example, to download
and install Java 11 on RedHat Linux run the following command.

....
$ yum install java-11-openjdk-devel
....

Set the environment variables `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH`.

....
$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk
$ export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$JRE_HOME/bin
....

The build output should now include the following.

....
[echo] Non default JDK version used: 11
...
...
_build_java:
    [echo] Compiling for Java 11
...
...

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 1 minute 3 seconds

== Common Issues

The Java 11 built Apache Cassandra 4.0 source code may be run with Java
11 only. If a Java 11 built code is run with Java 8 the following error
message gets output.

....
