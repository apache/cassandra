Code Style
==========

General Code Conventions
------------------------

 - The Cassandra project follows `Sun's Java coding conventions <http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html>`_ with an important exception: ``{`` and ``}`` are always placed on a new line

Exception handling
------------------

 - Never ever write ``catch (...) {}`` or ``catch (...) { logger.error() }`` merely to satisfy Java's compile-time exception checking. Always propagate the exception up or throw ``RuntimeException`` (or, if it "can't happen," ``AssertionError``). This makes the exceptions visible to automated tests.
 - Avoid propagating up checked exceptions that no caller handles. Rethrow as ``RuntimeException`` (or ``IOError``, if that is more applicable).
 - Similarly, logger.warn() is often a cop-out: is this an error or not? If it is don't hide it behind a warn; if it isn't, no need for the warning.
 - If you genuinely know an exception indicates an expected condition, it's okay to ignore it BUT this must be explicitly explained in a comment.

Boilerplate
-----------

 - Do not implement equals or hashcode methods unless they are actually needed.
 - Prefer public final fields to private fields with getters. (But prefer encapsulating behavior in "real" methods to either.)
 - Prefer requiring initialization in the constructor to setters.
 - Avoid redundant ``this`` references to member fields or methods.
 - Do not extract interfaces (or abstract classes) unless you actually need multiple implementations of it.
 - Always include braces for nested levels of conditionals and loops. Only avoid braces for single level.

Multiline statements
--------------------

 - Try to keep lines under 120 characters, but use good judgement -- it's better to exceed 120 by a little, than split a line that has no natural splitting points.
 - When splitting inside a method call, use one line per parameter and align them, like this:

 ::

   SSTableWriter writer = new SSTableWriter(cfs.getTempSSTablePath(),
                                            columnFamilies.size(),
                                            StorageService.getPartitioner());

 - When splitting a ternary, use one line per clause, carry the operator, and align like this:

 ::

   var = bar == null
       ? doFoo()
       : doBar();

Whitespace
----------

 - Please make sure to use 4 spaces instead of the tab character for all your indentation.
 - Many lines in many files have a bunch of trailing whitespace... Please either clean these up in a separate patch, or leave them alone, so that reviewers now and anyone reading code history later doesn't have to pay attention to whitespace diffs.

Imports
-------

Please observe the following order for your imports::

   java
   [blank line]
   com.google.common
   org.apache.commons
   org.junit
   org.slf4j
   [blank line]
   everything else alphabetically

Format files for IDEs
---------------------

 - IntelliJ: `intellij-codestyle.jar <https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/CodeStyle?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=intellij-codestyle.jar>`_
 - IntelliJ 13: `gist for IntelliJ 13 <https://gist.github.com/jdsumsion/9ab750a05c2a567c6afc>`_ (this is a work in progress, still working on javadoc, ternary style, line continuations, etc)
 - Eclipse (https://github.com/tjake/cassandra-style-eclipse)
