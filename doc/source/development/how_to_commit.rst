How-to Commit
=============

If you are a committer, feel free to pick any process that works for you - so long as you are planning to commit the work yourself.

Here is how committing and merging will usually look for merging and pushing for tickets that follow the convention (if patch-based):

Hypothetical CASSANDRA-12345 ticket is a cassandra-3.0 based bug fix that requires different code for cassandra-3.3, and trunk. Contributor Jackie supplied a patch for the root branch (12345-3.0.patch), and patches for the remaining branches (12345-3.3.patch, 12345-trunk.patch).

On cassandra-3.0:
   #. ``git am -3 12345-3.0.patch`` (if we have a problem b/c of CHANGES.txt not merging anymore, we fix  it ourselves, in place)
   #. ``ant realclean && ant jar build-test`` (rebuild to make sure code compiles)

On cassandra-3.3:
   #. ``git merge cassandra-3.0 -s ours``
   #. ``git apply -3 12345-3.3.patch`` (likely to have an issue with CHANGES.txt here: fix it ourselves, then git add CHANGES.txt)
   #. ``ant realclean && ant jar build-test`` (rebuild to make sure code compiles)
   #. ``git commit --amend``

On trunk:
   #. ``git merge cassandra-3.3 -s ours``
   #. ``git apply -3 12345-trunk.patch`` (likely to have an issue with CHANGES.txt here: fix it ourselves, then git add CHANGES.txt)
   #. ``ant realclean && ant jar build-test`` (rebuild to make sure code compiles)
   #. ``git commit --amend``

On any branch:
   #. ``git push origin cassandra-3.0 cassandra-3.3 trunk --atomic``

Same scenario, but a branch-based contribution:

On cassandra-3.0:
   #. ``git cherry-pick <sha-of-3.0-commit>`` (if we have a problem b/c of CHANGES.txt not merging anymore, we fix it ourselves, in place)
   #. ``ant realclean && ant jar build-test`` (rebuild to make sure code compiles)

On cassandra-3.3:
   #. ``git merge cassandra-3.0 -s ours``
   #. ``git format-patch -1 <sha-of-3.3-commit>``
   #. ``git apply -3 <sha-of-3.3-commit>.patch`` (likely to have an issue with CHANGES.txt here: fix it ourselves, then git add CHANGES.txt)
   #. ``ant realclean && ant jar build-test`` (rebuild to make sure code compiles)
   #. ``git commit --amend``

On trunk:
   #. ``git merge cassandra-3.3 -s ours``
   #. ``git format-patch -1 <sha-of-trunk-commit>``
   #. ``git apply -3 <sha-of-trunk-commit>.patch`` (likely to have an issue with CHANGES.txt here: fix it ourselves, then git add CHANGES.txt)
   #. ``ant realclean && ant jar build-test`` (rebuild to make sure code compiles)
   #. ``git commit --amend``

On any branch:
   #. ``git push origin cassandra-3.0 cassandra-3.3 trunk --atomic``

If the patch is for an older branch, and doesn't impact later branches (such as trunk), we still need to merge up.

On cassandra-3.0:
   #. ``git cherry-pick <sha-of-3.0-commit>`` (if we have a problem b/c of CHANGES.txt not merging anymore, we fix it ourselves, in place)
   #. ``ant realclean && ant jar build-test`` (rebuild to make sure code compiles)

On cassandra-3.3:
   #. ``git merge cassandra-3.0 -s ours``
   #. ``ant realclean && ant jar build-test`` (rebuild to make sure code compiles)

On trunk:
   #. ``git merge cassandra-3.3 -s ours``
   #. ``ant realclean && ant jar build-test`` (rebuild to make sure code compiles)

On any branch:
   #. ``git push origin cassandra-3.0 cassandra-3.3 trunk --atomic``

.. tip::

   Notes on git flags:
   ``-3`` flag to am and apply will instruct git to perform a 3-way merge for you. If a conflict is detected, you can either resolve it manually or invoke git mergetool - for both am and apply.

   ``--atomic`` flag to git push does the obvious thing: pushes all or nothing. Without the flag, the command is equivalent to running git push once per each branch. This is nifty in case a race condition happens - you won’t push half the branches, blocking other committers’ progress while you are resolving the issue.

.. tip::

   The fastest way to get a patch from someone’s commit in a branch on GH - if you don’t have their repo in remotes -  is to append .patch to the commit url, e.g.
   curl -O https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/7374e9b5ab08c1f1e612bf72293ea14c959b0c3c.patch
