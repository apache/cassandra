Error Codes
-----------

In Cassandra 3.10 and higher, when the v5 native protocol (or a higher version) is used,
``ReadFailure`` and ``WriteFailure`` errors will contain a map of replica addresses
to error codes.  Those error codes are explained here:

``0x0000``
  The error does not have a specific code assigned yet, or the cause is unknown.

``0x0001``
  The read operation scanned too many tombstones (as defined by ``tombstone_failure_threshold`` in ``cassandra.yaml``),
  causing a TombstoneOverwhelmingException.
