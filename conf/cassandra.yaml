cluster_name: 'Test Cluster'

# You should always specify InitialToken when setting up a production
# cluster for the first time, and often when adding capacity later.
# The principle is that each node should be given an equal slice of
# the token ring; see http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations
# for more details.
#
# If blank, Cassandra will request a token bisecting the range of
# the heaviest-loaded existing node.  If there is no load information
# available, such as is the case with a new cluster, it will pick
# a random token, which will lead to hot spots.
initial_token:

# Set to true to make new [non-seed] nodes automatically migrate data
# to themselves from the pre-existing nodes in the cluster.  Defaults
# to false because you can only bootstrap N machines at a time from
# an existing cluster of N, so if you are bringing up a cluster of
# 10 machines with 3 seeds you would have to do it in stages.  Leaving
# this off for the initial start simplifies that.
auto_bootstrap: false

# The partitioner is responsible for distributing rows (by key) across
# nodes in the cluster.  Any IPartitioner may be used, including your
# own as long as it is on the classpath.  Out of the box, Cassandra
# provides org.apache.cassandra.dht.RandomPartitioner
# org.apache.cassandra.dht.ByteOrderedPartitioner,
# org.apache.cassandra.dht.OrderPreservingPartitioner (deprecated),
# and org.apache.cassandra.dht.CollatingOrderPreservingPartitioner
# (deprecated).
# 
# - RandomPartitioner distributes rows across the cluster evenly by md5.
#   When in doubt, this is the best option.
# - ByteOrderedPartitioner orders rows lexically by key bytes.  BOP allows
#   scanning rows in key order, but the ordering can generate hot spots
#   for sequential insertion workloads.
# - OrderPreservingPartitioner is an obsolete form of BOP, that stores
# - keys in a less-efficient format and only works with keys that are
#   UTF8-encoded Strings.
# - CollatingOPP colates according to EN,US rules rather than lexical byte
#   ordering.  Use this as an example if you need custom collation.
#
# See http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations for more on
# partitioners and token selection.

# Number of compaction threads. This default to the number of processors,

#  - weights -- Weights are optional and will default to 1 or the
#               overridden default_weight. The weight translates into how
