# This file changes the configuration for tests to match the
# cassandra_latest.yaml file, which enables new features.

# This file was constructed by running:
# `diff conf/cassandra.yaml conf/cassandra_latest.yaml  | grep '^>' | cut -c 3-`
# and moving the `default: inherits: trie` lines to the start of the file.
# On any change to this file, please also update
# test/distributed/org/apache/cassandra/distributed/impl/InstanceConfig.java

# Change default memtable implementation to TrieMemtable
# Note: this attaches at the end of cassandra.yaml, where the memtable configuration setting must be.
