# Datacenter and rack naming convention used by the Ec2Snitch and Ec2MultiRegionSnitch.
# Options are:
#   legacy : datacenter name is the part of the availability zone name preceding the last "-"
#       when the zone ends in -1 and includes the number if not -1. Rack is the portion of
#       the availability zone name following  the last "-".
#       Examples: us-west-1a => dc: us-west, rack: 1a; us-west-2b => dc: us-west-2, rack: 2b; 
#   standard : datacenter name is the standard AWS region name, including the number. rack name is the
#       region plus the availability zone letter.
#       Examples: us-west-1a => dc: us-west-1, rack: us-west-1a; us-west-2b => dc: us-west-2, rack: us-west-2b;
# default: standard
