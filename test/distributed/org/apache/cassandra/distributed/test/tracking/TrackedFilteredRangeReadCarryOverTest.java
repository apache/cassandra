/**
 * A filtered tracked range read that reads the keys reconciliation flagged over more than one round of follow up
 * reads. {@code FilteredFollowupRead} reads flagged keys in key order while its budget of rows lasts and carries the
 * rest over to the next round; this is the read where the keys it read return nothing and a key it carried over
 * holds the answer.
 * <p>
 * Node 1, which coordinates and is the data replica, holds two partitions neither of which matches, and misses one
 * later write to each. Each write sets {@code a = 1}, which satisfies one of the two expressions, so the scan drops
 * both partitions and flags each key with one potential match, and a budget of one row reads the first key and
 * carries the second over. With the default Murmur3 partitioner (1,'z') sorts before (1,'a'). (1,'z') is the key
 * read first, and its row's {@code b} is 3, so reading it again returns nothing and the answer after that round holds
 * no partition. (1,'a') is the key carried over, and its row's {@code b} is 2, so the correct answer is that row.
