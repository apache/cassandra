# Optional meta information on the generated columns in the above table
# The min and max only apply to text and blob types
# The distribution field represents the total unique population
# distribution of that column across rows.  Supported types are
# 
#      EXP(min..max)                        An exponential distribution over the range [min..max]
#      EXTREME(min..max,shape)              An extreme value (Weibull) distribution over the range [min..max]
#      GAUSSIAN(min..max,stdvrng)           A gaussian/normal distribution, where mean=(min+max)/2, and stdev is (mean-min)/stdvrng
#      GAUSSIAN(min..max,mean,stdev)        A gaussian/normal distribution, with explicitly defined mean and stdev
#      UNIFORM(min..max)                    A uniform distribution over the range [min, max]
#      FIXED(val)                           A fixed distribution, always returning the same value
#      Aliases: extr, gauss, normal, norm, weibull
#
#      If preceded by ~, the distribution is inverted
#
# Defaults for all columns are size: uniform(1..256), population: uniform(1..100B)
