# Apache Cassandra and Pull Requests

Apache Cassandra doesn't use GitHub pull requests as part of the development process.
In fact, this repository is a GitHub mirror of [the official repo](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cassandra.git). The development team has no control over it. We cannot merge or close any pull requests opened for the apache/cassandra repository, so please don't open them.

# How to Contribute

Use [Cassandra JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA/) to create an issue, then either attach a patch or post a link to a GitHub branch with your changes.
