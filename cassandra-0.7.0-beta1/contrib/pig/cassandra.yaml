# A ColumnFamily is the Cassandra concept closest to a relational table.
#
# Keyspaces are separate groups of ColumnFamilies.  Except in very
# unusual circumstances you will have one Keyspace per application.
#
# Keyspace required parameters:
# - name: name of the keyspace; "system" and "definitions" are 
#   reserved for Cassandra Internals.
# - replica_placement_strategy: determines how replicas are distributed
#   among nodes. Contains both the class as well as configuration
#   information.
#    Must implement IReplicaPlacementStrategy.
#   Out of the box, Cassandra provides 
#     * org.apache.cassandra.locator.RackUnawareStrategy 
#     * org.apache.cassandra.locator.RackAwareStrategy
#     * org.apache.cassandra.locator.DatacenterShardStrategy
#
#   RackUnawareStrategy is the simplest; it simply places the first
#   replica at the node whose token is closest to the key (as determined
#   by the Partitioner), and additional replicas on subsequent nodes
#   along the ring in increasing Token order.
# 
#   RackAwareStrategy is special cased for replication_factor of 3.  It
#   places one replica in each of two datacenters, and the third on a
#   different rack in in the first.
#
#   DatacenterShardStrategy is a generalization of RackAwareStrategy.
#   For each datacenter, you can specify how many replicas you want
#   on a per-keyspace basis.  Replicas are placed on different racks
#   within each DC, if possible. This strategy also requires rack aware
#   snitch, such as RackInferringSnitch or PropertyFileSnitch.
#   An example:
#    - name: Keyspace1
#      replica_placement_strategy: org.apache.cassandra.locator.DatacenterShardStrategy
#      strategy_options:
#        DC1 : 3
#        DC2 : 2
#        DC3 : 1
# 
# - replication_factor: Number of replicas of each row
# - column_families: column families associated with this keyspace
#
# ColumnFamily required parameters:
# - name: name of the ColumnFamily.  Must not contain the character "-".
# - compare_with: tells Cassandra how to sort the columns for slicing
#   operations. The default is BytesType, which is a straightforward
#   lexical comparison of the bytes in each column.  Other options are
#   AsciiType, UTF8Type, LexicalUUIDType, TimeUUIDType, and LongType.
#   You can also specify the fully-qualified class name to a class of
#   your choice extending org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType.
#
# ColumnFamily optional parameters:
# - keys_cached: specifies the number of keys per sstable whose
#   locations we keep in memory in "mostly LRU" order.  (JUST the key
#   locations, NOT any column values.) Specify a fraction (value less
#   than 1) or an absolute number of keys to cache.  Defaults to 200000
#   keys.
# - rows_cached: specifies the number of rows whose entire contents we
#   cache in memory. Do not use this on ColumnFamilies with large rows,
#   or ColumnFamilies with high write:read ratios. Specify a fraction
#   (value less than 1) or an absolute number of rows to cache.
#   Defaults to 0. (i.e. row caching is off by default)
# - comment: used to attach additional human-readable information about 
#   the column family to its definition.
# - read_repair_chance: specifies the probability with which read
#   repairs should be invoked on non-quorum reads.  must be between 0
#   and 1. defaults to 1.0 (always read repair).
# - preload_row_cache: If true, will populate row cache on startup.
#   Defaults to false.
# - gc_grace_seconds: specifies the time to wait before garbage
#   collecting tombstones (deletion markers). defaults to 864000 (10
#   days). See http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/DistributedDeletes
#
# NOTE: this keyspace definition is for demonstration purposes only.
#       Cassandra will not load these definitions during startup. See
#       http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/FAQ#no_keyspaces for an explanation.
