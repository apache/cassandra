/**
 * The ConsistencyLevel is an enum that controls both read and write behavior based on <ReplicationFactor> in your
 * storage-conf.xml. The different consistency levels have different meanings, depending on if you're doing a write or read
 * operation. Note that if W + R > ReplicationFactor, where W is the number of nodes to block for on write, and R
 * the number to block for on reads, you will have strongly consistent behavior; that is, readers will always see the most
 * recent write. Of these, the most interesting is to do QUORUM reads and writes, which gives you consistency while still
 * allowing availability in the face of node failures up to half of <ReplicationFactor>. Of course if latency is more
 * important than consistency then you can use lower values for either or both.
 * 
 * Write:
 *      ZERO    Ensure nothing. A write happens asynchronously in background
 *      ANY     Ensure that the write has been written once somewhere, including possibly being hinted in a non-target node.
 *      ONE     Ensure that the write has been written to at least 1 node's commit log and memory table before responding to the client.
 *      QUORUM  Ensure that the write has been written to <ReplicationFactor> / 2 + 1 nodes before responding to the client.
 *      ALL     Ensure that the write is written to <code>&lt;ReplicationFactor&gt;</code> nodes before responding to the client.
 * 
 * Read:
 *      ZERO    Not supported, because it doesn't make sense.
 *      ANY     Not supported. You probably want ONE instead.
 *      ONE     Will return the record returned by the first node to respond. A consistency check is always done in a
 *              background thread to fix any consistency issues when ConsistencyLevel.ONE is used. This means subsequent
 *              calls will have correct data even if the initial read gets an older value. (This is called 'read repair'.)
 *      QUORUM  Will query all storage nodes and return the record with the most recent timestamp once it has at least a
 *              majority of replicas reported. Again, the remaining replicas will be checked in the background.
 *      ALL     Queries all storage nodes and returns the record with the most recent timestamp.
