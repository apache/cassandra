/**
 * This class handles streaming data from one node to another.
 *
 * The source node [the Out side] is always in charge of the streaming session.  Streams may
 * be initiated either directly by the source via the methods in this class,
 * or on demand from the target (via StreamRequest).
 *
 * Files to stream are grouped into sessions, which can have callbacks associated
 * with them so that (for instance) we can mark a new node a full member of the
 * cluster after all the data it needs has been streamed.
 *
 * The source begins a session by sending
 * a Message with the stream bit flag in the Header turned on.  Part of that Message
 * will include a StreamHeader that includes the files that will be streamed as part
 * of that session, as well as the first file-to-be-streamed. (Combining session list
 * and first file like this is inconvenient, but not as inconvenient as the old
 * three-part send-file-list, wait-for-ack, start-first-file dance.)
 *
 * This is done over a separate TCP connection to avoid blocking ordinary intra-node
 * traffic during the stream.  So there is no Handler for the main stream of data --
 * when a connection sets the Stream bit, IncomingTcpConnection knows what to expect
 * without any further Messages.
 *
 * After each file, the target node [the In side] will send a StreamReply indicating success
 * (FILE_FINISHED) or failure (FILE_RETRY).
 *
 * When all files have been successfully transferred and integrated the target will
 * send an additional SESSION_FINISHED reply and the session is complete.
 *
 * For Stream requests (for bootstrap), one subtlety is that we always have to
 * create at least one stream reply, even if the list of files is empty, otherwise the
 * target has no way to know that it can stop waiting for an answer.
