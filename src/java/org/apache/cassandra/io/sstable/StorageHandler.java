 * <p/>
 * If sstables are stored on the local disk, then this handler is a thin wrapper of {@link Directories.SSTableLister},
 * but for sstables stored remotely, for example on S3, then the handler may need to perform more
 * work, such as selecting only part of the remote sstables available, or adding new ones when offline compaction
 * has run. This behaviour can be implemented in a sub-class that can be set with {@link #remoteStorageHandler}.
 * <p/>
 * Local sytem tables will always use the default storage handler, {@link DefaultStorageHandler}
 * whereas user tables will use {@link #remoteStorageHandler} if one is set, or the default handler if none
 * has been set.
