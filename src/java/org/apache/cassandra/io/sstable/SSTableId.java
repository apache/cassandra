 * uniqueness will be deprecated and eventually removed.
 * <p>
 * A new implementation must adhere to the following invariants:
 * - Must be locally sortable - that is, the comparison must reflect the comparison of generation times of identifiers
 * generated on the same node
 * - String representation must *not* include the {@link Descriptor#FILENAME_SEPARATOR} character, see {@link Descriptor#fromFilenameWithComponent(File)}
 * - must be case-insensitive because the sstables can be stored on case-insensitive file system
