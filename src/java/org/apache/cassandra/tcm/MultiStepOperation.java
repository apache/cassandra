/**
 * Represents a multi-step process performed in order to transition the cluster to some state.
 *
 * For example, in order to join, the joining node has to execute the following steps:
 *   * PrepareJoin, which introduces node's tokens, but makes no changes to range ownership, and creates BootstrapAndJoin
 *     in-progress sequence
 *   * StartJoin, which adds the bootstrapping node to the write placements for the ranges it gains
 *   * MidJoin, which adds the bootstrapping node to the read placements for the ranges it has gained, and removes
 *     owners of these ranges from the read placements
 *   * FinishJoin, which removes owners of the gained ranges from the write placements.
 *
 * A multi-step operation necessarily holds all data required to execute the next step in sequence. All in-progress
 * operation can be interleaved, as long as their internal logic permits. In other words, an arbitrary number of join,
 * move, leave, and replace sequences can be in flight at any point in time, as long as they operate on non-overlapping
 * ranges.
 *
 * It is assumed that the node may crash after committing any of the steps. {@link MultiStepOperation#executeNext()}
 * should be implemented such that commits are done _after_ executing necessary prerequisites. For example,
 * streaming has to finish before MidJoin transformation (which adds the node to the read placements) is executed.
