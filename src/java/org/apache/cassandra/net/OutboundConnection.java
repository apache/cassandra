/**
 * Represents a connection type to a peer, and handles the state transistions on the connection and the netty {@link Channel}.
 * The underlying socket is not opened until explicitly requested (by sending a message).
 *
 * TODO: complete this description
 *
 * Aside from a few administrative methods, the main entry point to sending a message is {@link #enqueue(Message)}.
 * Any thread may send a message (enqueueing it to {@link #queue}), but only one thread may consume messages from this
 * queue.  There is a single delivery thread - either the event loop, or a companion thread - that has logical ownership
 * of the queue, but other threads may temporarily take ownership in order to perform book keeping, pruning, etc.,
 * to ensure system stability.
 *
 * {@link Delivery#run()} is the main entry point for consuming messages from the queue, and executes either on the event
 * loop or on a non-dedicated companion thread.  This processing is activated via {@link Delivery#execute()}.
 *
 * Almost all internal state maintenance on this class occurs on the eventLoop, a single threaded executor which is
 * assigned in the constructor.  Further details are outlined below in the class.  Some behaviours require coordination
 * between the eventLoop and the companion thread (if any).  Some minimal set of behaviours are permitted to occur on
 * producers to ensure the connection remains healthy and does not overcommit resources.
 *
 * All methods are safe to invoke from any thread unless otherwise stated.

     * This is to service messages that are too large to fully serialize on the eventLoop, as they could block
     * prompt service of other requests.  Since our serializers assume blocking IO, the easiest approach is to
     * ensure a companion thread performs blocking IO that, under the hood, is serviced by async IO on the eventLoop.
     *
     * Most of the work here is handed off to {@link AsyncChannelOutputPlus}, with our main job being coordinating
     * when and what we should run.
     *
     * To avoid allocating a huge number of threads across a cluster, we utilise the shared methods of {@link Delivery}
     * to ensure that only one run() is actually scheduled to run at a time - this permits us to use any {@link ExecutorService}
     * as a backing, with the number of threads defined only by the maximum concurrency needed to deliver all large messages.
     * We use a shared caching {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor}, and rename the Threads that service
     * our connection on entry and exit.
