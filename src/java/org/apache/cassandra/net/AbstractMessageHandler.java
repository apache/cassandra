/**
 * Core logic for handling inbound message deserialization and execution (in tandem with {@link FrameDecoder}).
 *
 * Handles small and large messages, corruption, flow control, dispatch of message processing to a suitable
 * consumer.
 *
 * # Interaction with {@link FrameDecoder}
 *
 * An {@link AbstractMessageHandler} implementation sits on top of a {@link FrameDecoder} in the Netty pipeline,
 * and is tightly coupled with it.
 *
 * {@link FrameDecoder} decodes inbound frames and relies on a supplied {@link FrameProcessor} to act on them.
 * {@link AbstractMessageHandler} provides two implementations of that interface:
 *  - {@link #process(Frame)} is the default, primary processor, and is expected to be implemented by subclasses
 *  - {@link UpToOneMessageFrameProcessor}, supplied to the decoder when the handler is reactivated after being
 *    put in waiting mode due to lack of acquirable reserve memory capacity permits
 *
 * Return value of {@link FrameProcessor#process(Frame)} determines whether the decoder should keep processing
 * frames (if {@code true} is returned) or stop until explicitly reactivated (if {@code false} is). To reactivate
 * the decoder (once notified of available resource permits), {@link FrameDecoder#reactivate()} is invoked.
 *
 * # Frames
 *
 * {@link AbstractMessageHandler} operates on frames of messages, and there are several kinds of them:
 *  1. {@link IntactFrame} that are contained. As names suggest, these contain one or multiple fully contained
 *     messages believed to be uncorrupted. Guaranteed to not contain an part of an incomplete message.
 *     See {@link #processFrameOfContainedMessages(ShareableBytes, Limit, Limit)}.
 *  2. {@link IntactFrame} that are NOT contained. These are uncorrupted parts of a large message split over multiple
 *     parts due to their size. Can represent first or subsequent frame of a large message.
 *     See {@link #processFirstFrameOfLargeMessage(IntactFrame, Limit, Limit)} and
 *     {@link #processSubsequentFrameOfLargeMessage(Frame)}.
 *  3. {@link CorruptFrame} with corrupt header. These are unrecoverable, and force a connection to be dropped.
 *  4. {@link CorruptFrame} with a valid header, but corrupt payload. These can be either contained or uncontained.
 *     - contained frames with corrupt payload can be gracefully dropped without dropping the connection
 *     - uncontained frames with corrupt payload can be gracefully dropped unless they represent the first
 *       frame of a new large message, as in that case we don't know how many bytes to skip
 *     See {@link #processCorruptFrame(CorruptFrame)}.
 *
 *  Fundamental frame invariants:
 *  1. A contained frame can only have fully-encapsulated messages - 1 to n, that don't cross frame boundaries
 *  2. An uncontained frame can hold a part of one message only. It can NOT, say, contain end of one large message
 *     and a beginning of another one. All the bytes in an uncontained frame always belong to a single message.
 *
 * # Small vs large messages
 *
 * A single handler is equipped to process both small and large messages, potentially interleaved, but the logic
 * differs depending on size. Small messages are deserialized in place, and then handed off to an appropriate
 * thread pool for processing. Large messages accumulate frames until completion of a message, then hand off
 * the untouched frames to the correct thread pool for the verb to be deserialized there and immediately processed.
 *
 * See {@link LargeMessage} and subclasses for concrete {@link AbstractMessageHandler} implementations for details
 * of the large-message accumulating state-machine, and {@link ProcessMessage} and its inheritors for the differences
 *in execution.
 *
 * # Flow control (backpressure)
 *
 * To prevent message producers from overwhelming and bringing nodes down with more inbound messages that
 * can be processed in a timely manner, {@link AbstractMessageHandler} provides support for implementations to
 * provide their own flow control policy.
 *
 * Before we attempt to process a message fully, we first infer its size from the stream. This inference is
 * delegated to implementations as the encoding of the message size is protocol specific. Having assertained
 * the size of the incoming message, we then attempt to acquire the corresponding number of memory permits.
 * If we succeed, then we move on actually process the message. If we fail, the frame decoder deactivates
 * until sufficient permits are released for the message to be processed and the handler is activated again.
 * Permits are released back once the message has been fully processed - the definition of which is again
 * delegated to the concrete implementations.
 *
 * Every connection has an exclusive number of permits allocated to it. In addition to it, there is a per-endpoint
 * reserve capacity and a global reserve capacity {@link Limit}, shared between all connections from the same host
 * and all connections, respectively. So long as long as the handler stays within its exclusive limit, it doesn't
 * need to tap into reserve capacity.
 *
 * If tapping into reserve capacity is necessary, but the handler fails to acquire capacity from either
 * endpoint of global reserve (and it needs to acquire from both), the handler and its frame decoder become
 * inactive and register with a {@link WaitQueue} of the appropriate type, depending on which of the reserves
 * couldn't be tapped into. Once enough messages have finished processing and had their permits released back
 * to the reserves, {@link WaitQueue} will reactivate the sleeping handlers and they'll resume processing frames.
 *
 * The reason we 'split' reserve capacity into two limits - endpoing and global - is to guarantee liveness, and
 * prevent single endpoint's connections from taking over the whole reserve, starving other connections.
 *
 * One permit per byte of serialized message gets acquired. When inflated on-heap, each message will occupy more
 * than that, necessarily, but despite wide variance, it's a good enough proxy that correlates with on-heap footprint.

     * A special-purpose wait queue to park inbound message handlers that failed to allocate
     * reserve capacity for a message in. Upon such failure a handler registers itself with
     * a {@link WaitQueue} of the appropriate kind (either ENDPOINT or GLOBAL - if failed
     * to allocate endpoint or global reserve capacity, respectively), stops processing any
     * accumulated frames or receiving new ones, and waits - until reactivated.
     *
     * Every time permits are returned to an endpoint or global {@link Limit}, the respective
     * queue gets signalled, and if there are any handlers registered in it, we will attempt
     * to reactivate as many waiting handlers as current available reserve capacity allows
     * us to - immediately, on the {@link #signal()}-calling thread. At most one such attempt
     * will be in progress at any given time.
     *
     * Handlers that can be reactivated will be grouped by their {@link EventLoop} and a single
     * {@link ReactivateHandlers} task will be scheduled per event loop, on the corresponding
     * event loops.
     *
     * When run, the {@link ReactivateHandlers} task will ask each handler in its group to first
     * process one message - using preallocated reserve capacity - and if no obstacles were met -
     * reactivate the handlers, this time using their regular reserves.
     *
     * See {@link WaitQueue#schedule()}, {@link ReactivateHandlers#run()}, {@link Ticket#reactivateHandler(Limit)}.
