    /**
     * Setting a Severity allows operators to inject preference information into the Dynamic Snitch
     * replica selection.
     *
     * When choosing which replicas to participate in a read request, the DSnitch sorts replicas
     * by response latency, and selects the fastest replicas.  Latencies are normalized to a score
     * from 0 to 1,  with lower scores being faster.
     *
     * The Severity injected here will be added to the normalized score.
     *
     * Thus, adding a Severity greater than 1 will mean the replica will never be contacted
     * (unless needed for ALL or if it is added later for rapid read protection).
     *
     * Conversely, adding a negative Severity means the replica will *always* be contacted.
     *
     * (The "Severity" term is historical and dates to when this was used to represent how
     * badly background tasks like compaction were affecting a replica's performance.
     * See CASSANDRA-3722 for when this was introduced and CASSANDRA-11738 for why it was removed.)
