/**
 * Weighted queue is a wrapper around any blocking queue that turns it into a blocking weighted queue. The queue
 * will weigh each element being added and removed. Adding to the queue is blocked if adding would violate
 * the weight bound.
 *
 * If an element weighs in at larger than the capacity of the queue then exactly one such element will be allowed
 * into the queue at a time.
 *
 * If the weight of an object changes after it is added you are going to have a bad time. Checking weight should be
 * cheap so memoize expensive to compute weights. If weight throws that can also result in leaked permits so it's
 * always a good idea to memoize weight so it doesn't throw.
 *
 * In the interests of not writing unit tests for methods no one uses there is a lot of UnsupportedOperationException.
 * If you need them then add them and add proper unit tests to WeightedQueueTest. "Good" tests. 100% coverage including
 * exception paths and resource leaks.
