/**
 * An abstraction for Transactional behaviour. An object implementing this interface has a lifetime
 * of the following pattern:
 *
 * Throwable failure = null;
 * try (Transactional t1, t2 = ...)
 * {
 *     // do work with t1 and t2
 *     t1.prepareToCommit();
 *     t2.prepareToCommit();
 *     failure = t1.commit(failure);
 *     failure = t2.commit(failure);
 * }
 * logger.error(failure);
 *
 * If something goes wrong before commit() is called on any transaction, then on exiting the try block
 * the auto close method should invoke cleanup() and then abort() to reset any state.
 * If everything completes normally, then on exiting the try block the auto close method will invoke cleanup
 * to release any temporary state/resources
 *
 * All exceptions and assertions that may be thrown should be checked and ruled out during commit preparation.
 * Commit should generally never throw an exception unless there is a real correctness-affecting exception that
 * cannot be moved to prepareToCommit, in which case this operation MUST be executed before any other commit
 * methods in the object graph.
 *
 * If exceptions are generated by commit after this initial moment, it is not at all clear what the correct behaviour
 * of the system should be, and so simply logging the exception is likely best (since it may have been an issue
 * during cleanup, say), and rollback cannot now occur. As such all exceptions and assertions that may be thrown
 * should be checked and ruled out during commit preparation.
 *
 * Since Transactional implementations will abort any changes they've made if calls to prepareToCommit() and commit()
 * aren't made prior to calling close(), the semantics of its close() method differ significantly from
 * most AutoCloseable implementations.
