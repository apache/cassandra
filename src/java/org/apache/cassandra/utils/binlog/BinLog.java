/**
 * Bin log is a is quick and dirty binary log that is kind of a NIH version of binary logging with a traditional logging
 * framework. It's goal is good enough performance, predictable footprint, simplicity in terms of implementation and configuration
 * and most importantly minimal impact on producers of log records.
 *
 * Performance safety is accomplished by feeding items to the binary log using a weighted queue and dropping records if the binary log falls
 * sufficiently far behind.
 *
 * Simplicity and good enough perforamance is achieved by using a single log writing thread as well as Chronicle Queue
 * to handle writing the log, making it available for readers, as well as log rolling.
