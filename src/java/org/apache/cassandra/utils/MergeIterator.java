    /**
     * A MergeIterator that consumes multiple input values per output value.
     *
     * The most straightforward way to implement this is to use a {@code PriorityQueue} of iterators, {@code poll} it to
     * find the next item to consume, then {@code add} the iterator back after advancing. This is not very efficient as
     * {@code poll} and {@code add} in all cases require at least {@code log(size)} comparisons (usually more than
     * {@code 2*log(size)}) per consumed item, even if the input is suitable for fast iteration.
     *
     * The implementation below makes use of the fact that replacing the top element in a binary heap can be done much
     * more efficiently than separately removing it and placing it back, especially in the cases where the top iterator
     * is to be used again very soon (e.g. when there are large sections of the output where only a limited number of
     * input iterators overlap, which is normally the case in many practically useful situations, e.g. levelled
     * compaction). To further improve this particular scenario, we also use a short sorted section at the start of the
     * queue.
     *
     * The heap is laid out as this (for {@code SORTED_SECTION_SIZE == 2}):
     *                 0
     *                 |
     *                 1
     *                 |
     *                 2
     *               /   \
     *              3     4
     *             / \   / \
     *             5 6   7 8
     *            .. .. .. ..
     * Where each line is a <= relationship.
     *
     * In the sorted section we can advance with a single comparison per level, while advancing a level within the heap
     * requires two (so that we can find the lighter element to pop up).
     * The sorted section adds a constant overhead when data is uniformly distributed among the iterators, but may up
     * to halve the iteration time when one iterator is dominant over sections of the merged data (as is the case with
     * non-overlapping iterators).
     *
     * The iterator is further complicated by the need to avoid advancing the input iterators until an output is
     * actually requested. To achieve this {@code consume} walks the heap to find equal items without advancing the
     * iterators, and {@code advance} moves them and restores the heap structure before any items can be consumed.
     * 
     * To avoid having to do additional comparisons in consume to identify the equal items, we keep track of equality
     * between children and their parents in the heap. More precisely, the lines in the diagram above define the
     * following relationship:
     *   parent <= child && (parent == child) == child.equalParent
     * We can track, make use of and update the equalParent field without any additional comparisons.
     *
     * For more formal definitions and proof of correctness, see CASSANDRA-8915.
