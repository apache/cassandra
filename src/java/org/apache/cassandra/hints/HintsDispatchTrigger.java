/**
 * A simple dispatch trigger that's being run every 10 seconds.
 *
 * Goes through all hint stores and schedules for dispatch all the hints for hosts that are:
 * 1. Not currently scheduled for dispatch, and
 * 2. Either have some hint files, or an active hint writer, and
 * 3. Are live, and
 * 4. Have matching schema versions
 *
 * What does triggering a hints store for dispatch mean?
 * - If there are existing hint files, it means submitting them for dispatch;
 * - If there is an active writer, closing it, for the next run to pick it up.
