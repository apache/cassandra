/**
 * Provides a proxy interface to the platform's MBeanServer instance to perform
 * role-based authorization on method invocation.
 *
 * When used in conjunction with a suitable JMXAuthenticator, which attaches a CassandraPrincipal
 * to authenticated Subjects, this class uses the configured IAuthorizer to verify that the
 * subject has the required permissions to execute methods on the MBeanServer and the MBeans it
 * manages.
 *
 * Because an ObjectName may contain wildcards, meaning it represents a set of individual MBeans,
 * JMX resources don't fit well with the hierarchical approach modelled by other IResource
 * implementations and utilised by ClientState::ensurePermission etc. To enable grants to use
 * pattern-type ObjectNames, this class performs its own custom matching and filtering of resources
 * rather than pushing that down to the configured IAuthorizer. To that end, during authorization
 * it pulls back all permissions for the active subject, filtering them to retain only grants on
 * JMXResources. It then uses ObjectName::apply to assert whether the target MBeans are wholly
 * represented by the resources with permissions. This means that it cannot use the PermissionsCache
 * as IAuthorizer can, so it manages its own cache locally.
 *
 * Methods are split into 2 categories; those which are to be invoked on the MBeanServer itself
 * and those which apply to MBean instances. Actually, this is somewhat of a construct as in fact
 * *all* invocations are performed on the MBeanServer instance, the distinction is made here on
 * those methods which take an ObjectName as their first argument and those which do not.
 * Invoking a method of the former type, e.g. MBeanServer::getAttribute(ObjectName name, String attribute),
 * implies that the caller is concerned with a specific MBean. Conversely, invoking a method such as
 * MBeanServer::getDomains is primarily a function of the MBeanServer itself. This class makes
 * such a distinction in order to identify which JMXResource the subject requires permissions on.
 *
 * Certain operations are never allowed for users and these are recorded in a deny list so that we
 * can short circuit authorization process if one is attempted by a remote subject.
 *
