/**
 * A decaying histogram reservoir where values collected during each minute will be twice as significant as the values
 * collected in the previous minute. Measured values are collected in variable sized buckets, using small buckets in the
 * lower range and larger buckets in the upper range. Use this histogram when you want to know if the distribution of
 * the underlying data stream has changed recently and you want high resolution on values in the lower range.
 *
 * The histogram use forward decay [1] to make recent values more significant. The forward decay factor will be doubled
 * every minute (half-life time set to 60 seconds) [2]. The forward decay landmark is reset every 30 minutes (or at
 * first read/update after 30 minutes). During landmark reset, updates and reads in the reservoir will be blocked in a
 * fashion similar to the one used in the metrics library [3]. The 30 minute rescale interval is used based on the
 * assumption that in an extreme case we would have to collect a metric 1M times for a single bucket each second. By the
 * end of the 30:th minute all collected values will roughly add up to 1.000.000 * 60 * pow(2, 30) which can be
 * represented with 56 bits giving us some head room in a signed 64 bit long.
 *
 * Internally two reservoirs are maintained, one with decay and one without decay. All public getters in a {@Snapshot}
 * will expose the decay functionality with the exception of the {@link Snapshot#getValues()} which will return values
 * from the reservoir without decay. This makes it possible for the caller to maintain precise deltas in an interval of
 * its choise.
 *
 * The bucket size starts at 1 and grows by 1.2 each time (rounding and removing duplicates). It goes from 1 to around
 * 18T by default (creating 164+1 buckets), which will give a timing resolution from microseconds to roughly 210 days,
 * with less precision as the numbers get larger.
 *
 * The series of values to which the counts in `decayingBuckets` correspond:
 * 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20, 24, 29, 35, 42, 50, 60, 72 etc.
 * Thus, a `decayingBuckets` of [0, 0, 1, 10] would mean we had seen 1 value of 3 and 10 values of 4.
 *
 * Each bucket represents values from (previous bucket offset, current offset].
