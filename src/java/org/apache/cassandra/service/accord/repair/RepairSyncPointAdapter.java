/**
 * Sync point adapter used for accord-only repairs.
 *
 * Repair has the requirement that all client writes begun before the repair will be fully replicated once repair
 * has completed. In the case of accord, repairs that compare data on disk satisfy this requirement by running
 * a sync point as part of streaming if differences are found. For accord-only repairs, the barrier used by normal
 * repairs is not sufficient since it only requires a quorum of nodes to respond before completing. This sync point
 * adapter requires responses from all of the supplied endpoints before completing. Note that shards only block on the
 * intersection of the provided replicas and their own endpoints.
