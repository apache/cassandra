/**
 * This update is used to support blocking read repair from non-transactional Cassandra reads. Cassandra creates
 * a read repair mutation per node and this enables some partitions to be readable that would otherwise run into messages
 * size limits.
 *
 * This update is used during the `Execute` phase to apply the repair mutations directly in AccordInteropExecution similar
 * to how Accord applies read repair mutations for normal Accord transactions. It will always produce an empty update
 * for Accord to use in the Apply phase because Accord doesn't support a per replica Apply and adding it would be redundant
 * with the support that exists in AccordInteropExecution.
 *
 * The state for this update is always kept in memory and is never serialized. Only the Id is propagated so the cache
 * can evict the update and then load it back. We don't need to persist it or have it be recoverable because if the original
 * coordinator fails to complete the transaction then the dependent Cassandra read that triggered the read repair will
 * also fail and it doesn't matter if the read repair is partially applied or not applied at all since it doesn't propose
 * new values.
 *
 * The reason we stash this in an Update that Accord won't actually use is that there isn't an explicit parameter
 * passing mechanism in Accord we can only provide implementations of Read, Query, and Update and then Accord will hand them
 * back via the Txn during execution.
