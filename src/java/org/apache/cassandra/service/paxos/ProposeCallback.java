/**
 * ProposeCallback has two modes of operation, controlled by the failFast parameter.
 *
 * In failFast mode, we will return a failure as soon as a majority of nodes reject
 * the proposal. This is used when replaying a proposal from an earlier leader.
 *
 * Otherwise, we wait for either all replicas to respond or until we achieve
 * the desired quorum. We continue to wait for all replicas even after we know we cannot succeed
 * because we need to know if no node at all have accepted or if at least one has.
 * In the former case, a proposer is guaranteed no-one will
 * replay its value; in the latter we don't, so we must timeout in case another
 * leader replays it before we can; see CASSANDRA-6013
