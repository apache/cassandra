/**
 * <p>This class serves as an entry-point to Cassandra's implementation of Paxos Consensus.
 * Note that Cassandra does not utilise the distinguished proposer (Multi Paxos) optimisation;
 * each operation executes its own instance of Paxos Consensus. Instead Cassandra employs
 * various optimisations to reduce the overhead of operations. This may lead to higher throughput
 * and lower overhead read operations, at the expense of contention during mixed or write-heavy workloads.
 *
 * Firstly, note that we do not follow Lamport's formulation, instead following the more common approach in
 * literature (see e.g. Dr. Heidi Howard's dissertation) of permitting any acceptor to vote on a proposal,
 * not only those who issued a promise.
 *
 * <h2>No Commit of Empty Proposals</h2>
 * <p>If a proposal is empty, there can be no effect to the state, so once this empty proposal has poisoned any earlier
 * proposal it is safe to stop processing. An empty proposal effectively scrubs the instance of consensus being
 * performed once it has reached a quorum, as no earlier incomplete proposal (that may perhaps have reached a minority)
 * may now be completed.
 *
 * <h2>Fast Read / Failed Write</h2>
 * <p>This optimisation relies on every voter having no incomplete promises, i.e. their commit register must be greater
 * than or equal to their promise and proposal registers (or there must be such an empty proposal).
 * Since the operation we are performing must invalidate any nascent operation that has reached a minority, and will
 * itself be invalidated by any newer write it might race with, we are only concerned about operations that might be
 * in-flight and incomplete. If we reach a quorum without any incomplete proposal, we prevent any incomplete proposal
 * that might have come before us from being committed, and so are correctly ordered.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: we could likely weaken this further, permitting a fast operation if we witness a stale incomplete operation
 * on one or more of the replicas, so long as we witness _some_ response that had knowledge of that operation's decision,
 * however we might waste more time performing optimistic reads (which we skip if we witness any in progress promise)
 *
 * <h2>Read Commutativity Optimisation</h2>
 * <p>We separate read and write promises into distinct registers. Since reads are commutative they do not need to be
 * ordered with respect to each other, so read promises consult only the write promise register to find competing
 * operations, whereas writes consult both read and write registers. This permits better utilisation of the Fast Read
 * optimisation, permitting arbitrarily many fast reads to execute concurrently.
 *
 * <p>A read will use its promise to finish any in progress write it encounters, but note that this is safe for multiple
 * reads to attempt simultaneously. If a write operation has not reached a quorum of promises then it has no effect,
 * so while some read operations may attempt to complete it and others may not, the operation will only be invalidated
 * and these actions will be equivalent. If the write had reached a quorum of promises then every reads will attempt
 * to complete the write. At the accept phase, only the most recent read promise will be accepted so whether the write
 * proposal had reached a quorum or not, a consistent outcome will result.
 *
 * <h2>Reproposal Avoidance</h2>
 * <p>It can occur that two (or more) commands begin competing to re-propose the same incomplete command even after it
 * has already committed - this can occur when an in progress command that has reached the commit condition (but not yet
 * committed) is encountered by a promise, so that it is re-proposed. If the original coordinator does not fail this
 * original command will be committed normally, but the re-proposal can take on a life of its own, and become contended
 * and re-proposed indefinitely. By having reproposals use the original proposal ballot's timestamp we spot this situation
 * and consider re-proposals of a command we have seen committed to be (in effect) empty proposals.
 *
 * <h2>Durability of Asynchronous Commit</h2>
 * To permit asynchronous commit (and also because we should) we ensure commits are durable once a proposal has been
 * accepted by a majority.
 *
 * Replicas track commands that have *locally* been witnessed but not committed. They may clear this log by performing
 * a round of Paxos Repair for each key in the log (which is simply a round of Paxos that tries not to interfere with
 * future rounds of Paxos, while aiming to complete any earlier incomplete round).
 *
 * By selecting some quorum of replicas for a range to perform this operation on, once successful we guarantee that
 * any transaction that had previously been accepted by a majority has been committed, and any transaction that had been
 * previously witnessed by a majority has been either committed or invalidated.
 *
 * To ensure durability across range movements, once a joining node becomes pending such a coordinated paxos repair
 * is performed prior to performing bootstrap, so that commands initiated before joining will either be bootstrapped
 * or completed by paxos repair to be committed to a majority that includes the new node in its calculations, and
 * commands initiated after will anyway do so due to being pending.
 *
 * Finally, for greater guarantees across range movements despite the uncertainty of gossip, paxos operations validate
 * ring information with each other while seeking a quorum of promises. Any inconsistency is resolved by synchronising
 * gossip state between the coordinator and the peers in question.
 *
 * <h2>Clearing of Paxos State</h2>
 * Coordinated paxos repairs as described above are preceded by an preparation step that determines a ballot below
 * which we agree to reject new promises. By deciding and disseminating this point prior to performing a coordinated
 * paxos repair, once complete we have ensured that all commands with a lower ballot are either committed or invalidated,
 * and so we are then able to disseminate this ballot as a bound below which may expunge all data for the range.
 *
 * For consistency of execution coordinators seek this latter ballot bound from each replica and, using the maximum of
 * these, ignore all data received associated with ballots lower than this bound.

    /**
     * Apply @param updates if and only if the current values in the row for @param key
     * match the provided @param conditions.  The algorithm is "raw" Paxos: that is, Paxos
     * minus leader election -- any node in the cluster may propose changes for any partition.
     *
     * The Paxos electorate consists only of the replicas for the partition key.
     * We expect performance to be reasonable, but CAS is still intended to be used
     * "when you really need it," not for all your updates.
     *
     * There are three phases to Paxos:
     *  1. Prepare: the coordinator generates a ballot (Ballot in our case) and asks replicas to
     *     - promise not to accept updates from older ballots and
     *     - tell us about the latest ballots it has already _promised_, _accepted_, or _committed_
     *     - reads the necessary data to evaluate our CAS condition
     *
     *  2. Propose: if a majority of replicas reply, the coordinator asks replicas to accept the value of the
     *     highest proposal ballot it heard about, or a new value if no in-progress proposals were reported.
     *  3. Commit (Learn): if a majority of replicas acknowledge the accept request, we can commit the new
     *     value.
     *
     *  Commit procedure is not covered in "Paxos Made Simple," and only briefly mentioned in "Paxos Made Live,"
     *  so here is our approach:
     *   3a. The coordinator sends a commit message to all replicas with the ballot and value.
     *   3b. Because of 1-2, this will be the highest-seen commit ballot.  The replicas will note that,
     *       and send it with subsequent promise replies.  This allows us to discard acceptance records
     *       for successfully committed replicas, without allowing incomplete proposals to commit erroneously
     *       later on.
     *
     *  Note that since we are performing a CAS rather than a simple update, when nodes respond positively to
     *  Prepare, they include read response of commited values that will be reconciled on the coordinator
     *  and checked against CAS precondition between the prepare and accept phases. This gives us a slightly
     *  longer window for another coordinator to come along and trump our own promise with a newer one but
     *  is otherwise safe.
     *
     *  Any successful prepare phase yielding a read that rejects the condition must be followed by the proposal of
     *  an empty update, to ensure the evaluation of the condition is linearized with respect to other reads and writes.
     *
     * @param key the row key for the row to CAS
     * @param request the conditions for the CAS to apply as well as the update to perform if the conditions hold.
     * @param consistencyForConsensus the consistency for the paxos prepare and propose round. This can only be either SERIAL or LOCAL_SERIAL.
     * @param consistencyForCommit the consistency for write done during the commit phase. This can be anything, except SERIAL or LOCAL_SERIAL.
     *
     * @return null if the operation succeeds in updating the row, or the current values corresponding to conditions.
     * (since, if the CAS doesn't succeed, it means the current value do not match the conditions).
