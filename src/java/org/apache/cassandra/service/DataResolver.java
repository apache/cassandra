        //      rows to create an iterator that is guaranteed to produce enough valid row results to satisfy the query

        //      "silent" replica has produced a more up-to-date result.
        //   2) This iterator is passed to the standard resolution process with read-repair, but is first wrapped in a 
        //      response provider that lazily "completes" potentially out-of-date rows by directly querying them on the
        //      replicas that were previously silent. As this iterator is consumed, it caches valid data for potentially
        //      out-of-date rows, and this cached data is merged with the fetched data as rows are requested. If there
        //      is no replica divergence, only rows in the partition being evalutated will be cached (then released
        //      when the partition is consumed).

        //      before it counts against the limit.
