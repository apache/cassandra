                 * of rows fetched: there is a high transactional cost for every individual request, but a relatively low
                 * marginal cost for each extra row requested.
                 *
                 * As such it's better to overfetch than to underfetch extra rows from a host; but at the same
                 * time we want to respect paging limits and not blow up spectacularly.
