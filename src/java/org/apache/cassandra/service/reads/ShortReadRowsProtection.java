         *        replica
         *     3. we haven't satisfied the client's limits yet, and should attempt to query for more rows to
         *        avoid a short read
         *
         * In the ideal scenario, we would get exactly min(a, b) or fewer rows from the next request, where a and b
         * are defined as follows:
         *     [a] limits.count() - mergedResultCounter.counted()
         *     [b] limits.perPartitionCount() - mergedResultCounter.countedInCurrentPartition()

         * It would be naive to query for exactly that many rows, as it's possible and not unlikely
         * that some of the returned rows would also be shadowed by tombstones from other hosts.
         *
         * Note: we don't know, nor do we care, how many rows from the replica made it into the reconciled result;
         * we can only tell how many in total we queried for, and that [0, mrc.countedInCurrentPartition()) made it.
         *
         * In general, our goal should be to minimise the number of extra requests - *not* to minimise the number
         * of rows fetched: there is a high transactional cost for every individual request, but a relatively low
         * marginal cost for each extra row requested.
         *
         * As such it's better to overfetch than to underfetch extra rows from a host; but at the same
         * time we want to respect paging limits and not blow up spectacularly.
         *
         * Note: it's ok to retrieve more rows that necessary since singleResultCounter is not stopping and only
         * counts.
         *
         * With that in mind, we'll just request the minimum of (count(), perPartitionCount()) limits.
         *
         * See CASSANDRA-13794 for more details.
