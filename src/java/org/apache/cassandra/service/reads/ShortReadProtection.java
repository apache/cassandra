/**

 * (i.e. it has stopped returning results due to the limit), but some of them haven't
 * made it into the final post-reconciliation result due to other nodes' row, range, and/or partition tombstones.
 *
 * If that is the case, then that node may have more rows that we should fetch, as otherwise we could
 * ultimately return fewer rows than required. Also, those additional rows may contain tombstones which
 * which we also need to fetch as they may shadow rows or partitions from other replicas' results, which we would
 * otherwise return incorrectly.

         * when it comes to calling SRRP.moreContents() and applyToRow() callbacks.
