/**
 * Consisting of a top level Index interface and two sub-interfaces which handle read and write operations,
 * Searcher and Indexer respectively, this defines a secondary index implementation.
 * Instantiation is done via reflection and implementations must provide a constructor which takes the base
 * table's ColumnFamilyStore and the IndexMetadata which defines the Index as arguments. e.g:
 *  {@code MyCustomIndex( ColumnFamilyStore baseCfs, IndexMetadata indexDef )}
 *
 * The main interface defines methods for index management, index selection at both write and query time,
 * as well as validation of values that will ultimately be indexed.
 * Two sub-interfaces are also defined, which represent single use helpers for short lived tasks at read and write time.
 * Indexer: an event listener which receives notifications at particular points during an update of a single partition
 *          in the base table.
 * Searcher: performs queries against the index based on a predicate defined in a RowFilter. An instance
 *          is expected to be single use, being involved in the execution of a single ReadCommand.
 *
 * The main interface includes factory methods for obtaining instances of both of the sub-interfaces;
 *
 * The methods defined in the top level interface can be grouped into 3 categories:
 *
 * Management Tasks:
 * This group of methods is primarily concerned with maintenance of secondary indexes are are mainly called from
 * SecondaryIndexManager. It includes methods for registering and un-registering an index, performing maintenance
 * tasks such as (re)building an index from SSTable data, flushing, invalidating and so forth, as well as some to
 * retrieve general metadata about the index (index name, any internal tables used for persistence etc).
 * Several of these maintenance functions have a return type of {@code Callable<?>}; the expectation for these methods is
 * that any work required to be performed by the method be done inside the Callable so that the responsibility for
 * scheduling its execution can rest with SecondaryIndexManager. For instance, a task like reloading index metadata
 * following potential updates caused by modifications to the base table may be performed in a blocking way. In
 * contrast, adding a new index may require it to be built from existing SSTable data, a potentially expensive task
 * which should be performed asynchronously.
 *
 * Index Selection:
 * There are two facets to index selection, write time and read time selection. The former is concerned with
 * identifying whether an index should be informed about a particular write operation. The latter is about providing
 * means to use the index for search during query execution.
 *
 * Validation:
 * Values that may be written to an index are checked as part of input validation, prior to an update or insert
 * operation being accepted.
 *
 *
 * Sub-interfaces:
 *
 * Update processing:
 * Indexes are subscribed to the stream of events generated by modifications to the base table. Subscription is
 * done via first registering the Index with the base table's SecondaryIndexManager. For each partition update, the set
 * of registered indexes are then filtered based on the properties of the update using the selection methods on the main
 * interface described above. Each of the indexes in the filtered set then provides an event listener to receive
 * notifications about the update as it is processed. As such then, a event handler instance is scoped to a single
 * partition update; SecondaryIndexManager obtains a new handler for every update it processes (via a call to the
 * factory method, indexerFor. That handler will then receive all events for the update, before being
 * discarded by the SecondaryIndexManager. Indexer instances are never re-used by SecondaryIndexManager and the
 * expectation is that each call to indexerFor should return a unique instance, or at least if instances can
 * be recycled, that a given instance is only used to process a single partition update at a time.
 *
 * Search:
 * Each query (i.e. a single ReadCommand) that uses indexes will use a single instance of Index.Searcher. As with
 * processing of updates, an Index must be registered with the primary table's SecondaryIndexManager to be able to
 * support queries. During the processing of a ReadCommand, the Expressions in its RowFilter are examined to determine
 * whether any of them are supported by a registered Index. supportsExpression is used to filter out Indexes which
 * cannot support a given Expression. After filtering, the set of candidate indexes are ranked according to the result
 * of getEstimatedResultRows and the most selective (i.e. the one expected to return the smallest number of results) is
 * chosen. A Searcher instance is then obtained from the searcherFor method and used to perform the actual Index lookup.
 * Finally, Indexes can define a post processing step to be performed on the coordinator, after results (partitions from
 * the primary table) have been received from replicas and reconciled. This post processing is defined as a
 * {@code java.util.functions.BiFunction<PartitionIterator, RowFilter, PartitionIterator>}, that is a function which takes as
 * arguments a PartitionIterator (containing the reconciled result rows) and a RowFilter (from the ReadCommand being
 * executed) and returns another iterator of partitions, possibly having transformed the initial results in some way.
 * The post processing function is obtained from the Index's postProcessorFor method; the built-in indexes which ship
 * with Cassandra return a no-op function here.
 *
 * An optional static method may be provided to validate custom index options (two variants are supported):
 *
 * <pre>{@code public static Map<String, String> validateOptions(Map<String, String> options);}</pre>
 *
 * The input is the map of index options supplied in the WITH clause of a CREATE INDEX statement.
 *
 * <pre>{@code public static Map<String, String> validateOptions(Map<String, String> options, TableMetadata metadata);}</pre>
 *
 * In this version, the base table's metadata is also supplied as an argument.
 * If both overloaded methods are provided, only the one including the base table's metadata will be invoked.
 *
 * The validation method should return a map containing any of the supplied options which are not valid for the
 * implementation. If the returned map is not empty, validation is considered failed and an error is raised.
 * Alternatively, the implementation may choose to throw an org.apache.cassandra.exceptions.ConfigurationException
 * if invalid options are encountered.
