# Storage-Attached Indexing

## Overview
Storage-attached indexes are a new column-based secondary indexing apparatus for DSE.

The project was inspired by OSS SASI (SSTable-Attached Secondary Indexes) and retains some of its high-level
architectural character (and even some actual code), but makes significant improvements in a number of areas:

- The on-disk/SSTable index formats for both string and numeric data have been completely replaced. Strings are indexed
  on disk using our proprietary on-disk byte-ordered trie data structure, while numeric types are indexed using Lucene's
  balanced kd-tree.
- While indexes continue to be managed at the column level from the user's perspective, the storage design at the column
  index level is row-based, with related offset and token information stored only once at the SSTable level. This
  drastically reduces our on-disk footprint when several columns are indexed on the same table.
- The query path is synchronous and index searches run on IO threads.
- Tracing, metrics, virtual table-based metadata, RLAC, and snapshot-based backup/restore are supported out of the box.

Many similarities with standard secondary indexes remain:

- The full set of C* consistency levels is supported for both reads and writes.
- Index updates are synchronous with mutations and do not require any kind of read-before-write.
- Queries are implemented on the back of C* range reads.
- Paging is supported.
- Only token ordering of results is supported.
- Index builds are visible to operators as compactions and are executed on compaction threads.
- All DML and DDL statements are CQL-based.
- Single-node management operations are available via nodetool. (ex. stop & rebuild_index)

## Quick Start

The following short tutorial will get you up-and-running with storage-attached indexing.

### Build and Start DSE

1.) Make sure you've created the following directories and given yourself permissions on them:

`/var/log/cassandra`

`/var/lib/cassandra`

2.) From the bdp root directory, run the following commands:

`./gradlew jar`

`bin/dse cassandra`

3.) When the node stabilizes, open up `cqlsh` from the bdp root directory.

`bin/cqlsh`

### Create a Simple Data Model

1.) Run the following DDL statements to create a table and two indexes:

`CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy' , 'Cassandra': '1'};`

`USE test;`

`CREATE TABLE person (id int, name text, age int, PRIMARY KEY (id));`

`CREATE CUSTOM INDEX ON person (name) USING 'StorageAttachedIndex' WITH OPTIONS = {'case_sensitive': false};`

`CREATE CUSTOM INDEX ON person (age) USING 'StorageAttachedIndex';`

2.) Add some data.

`INSERT INTO person (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John', 21);`

`INSERT INTO person (id, name, age) VALUES (2, 'john', 50);`

`INSERT INTO person (id, name, age) VALUES (3, 'Boris', 43);`

`INSERT INTO person (id, name, age) VALUES (4, 'Caleb', 34);`

### Make Some Queries

1.) Query for everyone named "John", ignoring case.

`SELECT * FROM person WHERE name = 'John';`

```
 id | age | name
----+-----+------
  1 |  21 | John
  2 |  50 | john
```

2.) Query for everyone between the ages of 18 and 25.

`SELECT * FROM person WHERE age >= 18 AND age <= 35;`

```
 id | age | name
----+-----+-------
  1 |  21 |  John
  4 |  34 | Caleb
```
