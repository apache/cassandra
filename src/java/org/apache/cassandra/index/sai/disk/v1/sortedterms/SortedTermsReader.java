/**
 * Provides read access to a sorted on-disk sequence of terms written by {@link SortedTermsWriter}.
 * <p>
 * Allows constant-time look up of the term at a given point id.
 * <p>
 * Care has been taken to make this structure as efficient as possible.
 * Reading terms does not require allocating data heap buffers per each read operation.
 * Only one term at a time is loaded to memory.
 * Low complexity algorithms are used â€“ a lookup of the term by point id is constant time,
 * and a lookup of the point id by the term is logarithmic.
 * <p>
 * Because the blocks are prefix compressed, random access applies only to the locating the whole block.
 * In order to jump to a concrete term inside the block, the block terms are iterated from the block beginning.
 * Expect random access by {@link Cursor#seekToPointId(long)} to be slower
 * than just moving to the next term with {@link Cursor#advance()}.
 * <p>
 * For documentation of the underlying on-disk data structures, see the package documentation.
