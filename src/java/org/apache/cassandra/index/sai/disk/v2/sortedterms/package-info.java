/**
 * Space-efficient on-disk data structure for storing a sorted sequence of terms.
 * Provides efficient lookup of terms by their point id, as well as locating them by contents.
 * <p>
 * All the code in the package uses the following teminology:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Term: arbitrary data provided by the user as a bunch of bytes. Terms can be of variable length.</li>
 *     <li>Point id: the ordinal position of a term in the sequence, 0-based.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Terms are stored in <code>ByteComparable</code> strictly ascending order.
 * Duplicates are not allowed.
 *
 * <p>
 * The structure is immutable, i.e. cannot be modified nor appended after writing to disk is completed.
 * You build it by adding terms in the ascending order using
 * {@link org.apache.cassandra.index.sai.disk.v2.sortedterms.SortedTermsWriter}.
 * Once saved to disk, you can open it for lookups with
 * {@link org.apache.cassandra.index.sai.disk.v2.sortedterms.SortedTermsReader}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The data structure comprises of the following components, each stored in a separate file:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>terms data, organized as a sequence of prefix-compressed blocks each storing 16 terms</li>
 *     <li>a monotonic list of file offsets of the blocks; this component allows to quickly locate the block
 *     that contains the term with a given point id</li>
 *     <li>a trie indexed by terms, with a long payload for the point id,
 *     to quickly locate the point id of a term by the term contents
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * The implementation has been based on code from Lucene version 7.5 SortedDocValues.
 * Prefix compression and bitpacking are used extensively to save space.
