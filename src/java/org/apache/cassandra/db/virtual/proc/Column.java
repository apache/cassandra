/**
 * Annotation to mark a walk order for a {@link RowWalker}. Annotation is used on a method that returns a value and
 * represents a column value for a row. The columns order is defined by the column type and the column name
 * in lexicographical order (case-insensitive) and the same way as in CQL (partition key columns first,
 * then clustering columns, then regular columns).
 * <p>
 * The column {@link Column.Type} type is the same as the existing CQL
 * {@code ColumnMetadata.Kind} and is used to define the column types for the virtual tables. All the classes
 * in the {@link org.apache.cassandra.db.virtual.proc} package are used by annotation processor to generate
 * {@link RowWalker} implementations, so they should have zero dependencies on the rest of the codebase.
