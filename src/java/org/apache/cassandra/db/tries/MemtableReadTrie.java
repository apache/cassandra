    TRIE FORMAT AND NODE TYPES

    The memtable trie uses five different types of nodes:
     - "leaf" nodes, which have content and no children;
     - single-transition "chain" nodes, which have exactly one child; while each node is a single transition, they are
       called "chain" because multiple such transition are packed in a block.
     - "sparse" nodes which have between two and six children;
     - "split" nodes for anything above six children;
     - "prefix" nodes that augment one of the other types (except leaf) with content.

    The data for all nodes except leaf ones is stored in a contiguous 'node buffer' and laid out in blocks of 32 bytes.
    A block only contains data for a single type of node, but there is no direct correspondence between block and node
    in that:
     - a single block can contain multiple "chain" nodes.
     - a sparse node occupies exactly one block.
     - a split node occupies a variable number of blocks.
     - a prefix node can be placed in the same block as the node it augments, or in a separate block.

    Nodes are referenced in that buffer by an integer position/pointer, the 'node pointer'. Note that node pointers are
    not pointing at the beginning of blocks, and we call 'pointer offset' the offset of the node pointer to the block it
    points into. The value of a 'node pointer' is used to decide what kind of node is pointed:

     - If the pointer is negative, we have a leaf node. Since a leaf has no children, we need no data outside of its
       content to represent it, and that content is stored in a 'content list', not in the nodes buffer. The content
       of a particular leaf node is located at the ~pointer position in the content list (~ instead of - so that -1 can
       correspond to position 0).

     - If the 'pointer offset' is smaller than 28, we have a chain node with one transition. The transition character is
       the byte at the position pointed in the 'node buffer', and the child is pointed by:
       - the integer value at offset 28 of the block pointed if the 'pointer offset' is 27
       - pointer + 1 (which is guaranteed to have offset smaller than 28, i.e. to be a chain node), otherwise
       In other words, a chain block contains a sequence of characters that leads to the child whose address is at
       offset 28. It may have between 1 and 28 characters depending on the pointer with which the block is entered.

     - If the 'pointer offset' is 30, we have a sparse node. The data of a sparse node occupies a full block and is laid
       out as:
       - six pointers to children at offsets 0 to 24
       - six transition characters at offsets 24 to 30
       - an order word stored in the two bytes at offset 30
       To enable in-place addition of children, the pointers and transition characters are not stored ordered.
       Instead, we use an order encoding in the last 2 bytes of the node. The encoding is a base-6 number which
       describes the order of the transitions (least significant digit being the smallest).
       The node must have at least two transitions and the transition at position 0 is never the biggest (we can
       enforce this by choosing for position 0 the smaller of the two transitions a sparse node starts with). This
       allows iteration over the order word (which divides said word by 6 each step) to finish when the result becomes 0.

     - If the 'pointer offset' is 28, the node is a split one. Split nodes are dense, meaning that there is a direct
       mapping between a transition character and the address of the associated pointer, and new children can easily be
       added in place.
       Split nodes occupy multiple blocks, and a child is located by traversing 3 layers of pointers:
       - the first pointer is within the top-level block (the one pointed by the pointer) and points to a "mid" block.
         The top-level block has 4 such pointers to "mid" block, located between offset 16 and 32.
       - the 2nd pointer is within the "mid" block and points to a "tail" block. A "mid" block has 8 such pointers
         occupying the whole block.
       - the 3rd pointer is with the "tail" block and is the actual child pointer. Like "mid" block, there are 8 such
         pointers (so we finally address 4 * 8 * 8 = 256 children).
       To find a child, we thus need to know the index of the pointer to follow within the top-level block, the index
       of the one in the "mid" block and the index in the "tail" block. For that, we split the transition byte in a
       sequence of 2-3-3 bits:
       - the first 2 bits are the index in the top-level block;
       - the next 3 bits, the index in the "mid" block;
       - and the last 3 bits the index in the "tail" block.
       This layout allows the node to use the smaller fixed-size blocks (instead of 256*4 bytes for the whole character
       space) and also leaves some room in the head block (the 16 first bytes) for additional information (which we can
       use to store prefix nodes containing things like deletion times).
       One split node may need up to 1 + 4 + 4*8 blocks (1184 bytes) to store all its children.

     - If the pointer offset is 31, we have a prefix node. These are two types:
       -- Embedded prefix nodes occupy the free bytes in a chain or split node. The byte at offset 4 has the offset
          within the 32-byte block for the augmented node.
       -- Full prefix nodes have 0xFF at offset 4 and a pointer at 28, pointing to the augmented node.
       Both types contain an index for content at offset 0. The augmented node cannot be a leaf or NONE -- in the former
       case the leaf itself contains the content index, in the latter we use a leaf instead.
       The term "node" when applied to these is a bit of a misnomer as they are not presented as separate nodes during
       traversals. Instead, they augment a node, changing only its content. Internally we create a Node object for the
       augmented node and wrap a PrefixNode around it, which changes the `content()` method and routes all other
       calls to the augmented node's methods.

     When building a trie we first allocate the content, then create a chain node leading to it. While we only have
     single transitions leading to a chain node, we can expand that node (attaching a character and using pointer - 1)
     instead of creating a new one. When a chain node already has a child and needs a new one added we change the type
     (i.e. create a new node and remap the parent) to sparse with two children. When a six-child sparse node needs a new
     child, we switch to split.

     Blocks currently are not reused, because we do not yet have a mechanism to tell when readers are done with blocks
     they are referencing. This currently causes a very low overhead (because we change data in place with the only
     exception of nodes needing to change type) and is planned to be addressed later.

     For an example of the evolution of the trie, see MemtableTrie.md.
