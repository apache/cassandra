/**
 * The clustering column values for a row.
 * <p>
 * A {@code Clustering} is a {@code ClusteringPrefix} that must always be "complete", i.e. have
 * as many values as there is clustering columns in the table it is part of. It is the clustering
 * prefix used by rows.
 * <p>
 * Note however that while it's size must be equal to the table clustering size, a clustering can have
 * {@code null} values (this is currently only allowed in COMPACT table for historical reasons, but we
 * could imagine lifting that limitation if we decide it make sense from a CQL point of view).
