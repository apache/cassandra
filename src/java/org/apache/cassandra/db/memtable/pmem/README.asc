Persistent Memory Limitation
----------------------------
Currently, the backend for Pmem Cassandra adopts Growable Heap from LLPL. i.e.  for each table we create a growable heap with NO limit; this means that each heap is allowed to grow until there is no space on the device.
There is a system limit that wonâ€™t allow the total MMAP space on a system within a single process, to grow more than approximately 129 Terabytes.
This means the more the memory provisioned for a namespace/partition, the fewer the tables that can be created in a Cassandra server instance.
So, while configuring a LLPL mount we should decide the namespace/partition size accordingly. Other schemes are possible and may be easier to administer.
